# ‚ùç Swift Example

Deploy Swift applications using sst ion.

## Build

Building your application for deployment requires installing Docker.

When deploying with `sst deploy` your application will be build for Amazon Linux, ensuring its campatible with the AWS Lambda provided runtime.

## Deploy

Deploy just like any other sst project:

```sh
sst deploy --stage production
```

## Multiple Targets

A simple Swift application might include just one lambda function to act as an http server. But a more complex application will want to take advantage of queues and other event driven architectures. This is trivial to do, simply create more `sst.aws.Function`s and reference the relevant target for that function in `build(someTarget)`. Any `executableTarget` in your `Package.swift` can be passed to build.

Here's an example of hooking up a target to an SQS Queue:

```typescript
const queue = new sst.aws.Queue("SwiftQueue", {});
queue.subscribe({
  runtime: "provided.al2023",
  architecture: process.arch === "arm64" ? "arm64" : "x86_64",
  bundle: build("queue"),
  handler: "bootstrap",
  url: true,
  streaming: false,
});
```
