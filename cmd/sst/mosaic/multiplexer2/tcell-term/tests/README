All tests in this directory should be compared against a known good terminal.
Personally, I compare to foot, but alacritty is known to be good too. The tests
can be run by 'cat'ing them to the terminal

These tests are pulled from:
https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/tree/master/alacritty_terminal/tests/ref
