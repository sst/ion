Today we are launching `Auth` — a modern lightweight authentication library for your SST apps.

With a simple set of configuration, it'll create a function that'll handle various authentication flows. You can then attach this function to your API and SST will help you manage the session tokens.

`Auth` is completely stateless, standards based, and free to use.

You can read more about it over on our docs.

## Overview

`Auth` is made up of the following pieces:

1. `Auth` — a construct that creates the necessary infrastructure.

   - The API routes to handle the authentication flows.
   - Securely generates a RSA public/private keypair to sign sessions.
   - Stores the RSA keypair as secrets in the app's `Config`.

2. `AuthHandler` — a Lambda handler function that can handle authentication flows for various providers.

   - High level adapters for common providers like Google, GitHub, Twitch, etc.
   - OIDC and OAuth adapters that work with any compatible service.
   - A `LinkAdapter` to generate login links that can be sent over email or SMS.
   - Can be extended with custom adapters to support more complex workflows, like multi-tenant SSO.

3. Session — a library for issuing and validating authentication sessions in your Lambda function code.

   - Implemented with stateless JWT tokens that are signed with the RSA keypairs mentioned above.
   - Support for passing tokens to the frontend via a cookie or the query string.
   - Full typesafety for issuing and validating sessions with the `useSession` hook.

## Launch event

We hosted a [launch livestream on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO9Chk6sUW4) where we did a demo and a deep dive into the internals.
