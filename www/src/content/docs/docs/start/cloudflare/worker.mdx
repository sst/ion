title: Cloudflare Workers with SST
description: Create and deploy a Cloudflare Worker as an API with SST.
---

We are going to build an API with a Cloudflare Worker, add an R2 bucket for file uploads, and deploy it using SST.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/cloudflare-worker) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [Create your Cloudflare API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/).

---

## 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our app.

```bash
mkdir my-worker && cd my-worker
npm init -y
```

---

#### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app. Make sure to add the `@ion` part.

```bash "sst@ion"
npx sst@ion init
npm install
```

Select the defaults and pick **Cloudflare**. This'll create a `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

---

#### Set the Cloudflare API token

You can save your Cloudflare API token in a `.env` file or just set it directly.

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=aaaaaaaa_aaaaaaaaaaaa_aaaaaaaa
```

---

## 2. Add a Worker

Let's add a Worker. Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
async run() {
  const worker = new sst.cloudflare.Worker("MyWorker", {
    handler: "./index.ts",
    url: true,
  });

  return {
    api: worker.url,
  };
}
```

We are enabling the Worker URL, so we can use it as our API.

---

## 3. Add an R2 Bucket

Let's add an R2 bucket for file uploads. Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const bucket = new sst.cloudflare.Bucket("MyBucket");
```

#### Link the bucket

Now, link the bucket to our Worker.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
const worker = new sst.cloudflare.Worker("MyWorker", {
  handler: "./index.ts",
  link: [bucket],
  url: true,
});
```

---

## 4. Upload a file

We want our API to upload a file to the R2 bucket if you make a `PUT` request to it. Create an `index.ts` file and add the following.

```ts title="index.ts" {5-9}
export default {
  async fetch(req: Request) {
    if (req.method == "PUT") {
      const key = crypto.randomUUID();
      await Resource.MyBucket.put(key, req.body, {
        httpMetadata: {
          contentType: req.headers.get("content-type"),
        },
      });
      return new Response(`Object created with key: ${key}`);
    }
  },
};
```

:::tip
We are uploading to our R2 bucket with the SDK â€” `Resource.MyBucket.put()`
:::

Import the SDK.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { Resource } from "sst";
```

---

## 5. Download a file

We want to download the last uploaded file if you make a `GET` request to the API. Add this to the `fetch` function in your `index.ts` file.

```ts title="index.ts"
if (req.method == "GET") {
  const first = await Resource.MyBucket.list().then(
    (res) =>
      res.objects.toSorted(
        (a, b) => a.uploaded.getTime() - b.uploaded.getTime(),
      )[0],
  );
  const result = await Resource.MyBucket.get(first.key);
  return new Response(result.body, {
    headers: {
      "content-type": result.httpMetadata.contentType,
    },
  });
}
```

We are getting a list of the files in the files in the bucket with `Resource.MyBucket.list()` and we are getting a file for the given key with `Resource.MyBucket.get()`.

---

#### Start dev mode

Start your app in dev mode.

```bash
npx sst dev
```

This will give you the URL of your API.

```bash frame="none"
+  Complete
   api: https://start-cloudflare-jayair-myworkerscript.sst-15d.workers.dev
```

---

#### Test your app

Let's try uploading a file from your project root. Make sure to use your API URL.

```bash
curl --upload-file package.json https://start-cloudflare-jayair-myworkerscript.sst-15d.workers.dev
```

Now head over to `https://start-cloudflare-jayair-myworkerscript.sst-15d.workers.dev` in your browser and it'll load the file you just uploaded.

---

## 6. Deploy your app

Finally, let's deploy your app!

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production.
