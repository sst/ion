title: Drizzle with Amazon RDS and SST
description: Use Drizzle and SST to manage and deploy your Amazon Postgres RDS database.
---

We are going to use Drizzle and SST to manage and deploy an Amazon Postgres RDS database.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-drizzle) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](/docs/iam-credentials#credentials).

---

## 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating a Node.js app.

```bash
mkdir my-drizzle-app && cd my-drizzle-app
npm init -y
```

---

#### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app.

```bash
npx sst@latest init
npm install
```

Select the defaults and pick **AWS**. This'll create a `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

---

#### Init Drizzle

Add Drizzle to your project. We're also adding the `pg` client that Drizzle will use.

```bash
npm install pg @types/pg drizzle-orm drizzle-kit
```

Drizzle ORM is what will be used to query our database, while Drizzle Kit will allow us to run migrations. It also comes with Drizzle Studio, a query browser.

Let's add the following to the `scripts` in the `package.json`.

```json title="package.json" "sst shell"
"scripts": {
  "db": "sst shell drizzle-kit"
},
```

The `sst shell` CLI will pass the credentials to Drizzle Kit and allow it to connect to your database.

Let's also update our `tsconfig.json`.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

---

## 2. Add a Postgres db

Let's add a Postgres database using [Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html). This needs a VPC.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
async run() {
  const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc", { bastion: true, nat: "ec2" });
  const rds = new sst.aws.Postgres("MyPostgres", { vpc, proxy: true });
},
```

The `proxy` option configures an RDS Proxy behind the scenes making it ideal for serverless applications. Update your `sst.config.ts`.

:::tip
The RDS Proxy allows serverless environments to reliably connect to RDS.
:::

While the `bastion` option will let us connect to the VPC from our local machine. We also need the NAT gateway for this example since we'll be using a Lambda function, and this allows a Lambda function that's in a VPC to access the internet.

---

#### Start Drizzle Studio

When you run SST in dev it can start other dev processes for you. In this case we want to start Drizzle Studio. Add this below the `Postgres` component.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
new sst.x.DevCommand("Studio", {
  link: [rds],
  dev: {
    autostart: true,
    command: "npx drizzle-kit studio",
  },
});
```

This will run the given command in dev.

---

#### Add an API

We'll use a Lambda function as an API to query our database. Add the following to your `sst.config.ts` below the database config.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {4}
const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyApi", {
  vpc,
  url: true,
  link: [rds],
  handler: "src/api.handler",
});

return {
  api: api.url,
};
```

We are linking our database to the API.

---

#### Install a tunnel

Since our database cluster is in a VPC, we'll need a tunnel to connect to it from our local machine.

```bash "sudo"
sudo npx sst tunnel install
```

This needs _sudo_ to create a network interface on your machine. You'll only need to do this once on your machine.

---

#### Start dev mode

Start your app in dev mode. This runs your functions [_Live_](/docs/live/).

```bash
npx sst dev
```

It'll take a few minutes to create your database. Once complete, you'll see this.

```bash frame="none"
âœ“  Complete
   api: https://ouu5vovpxllyn5b6ot2nn6vdsa0hvcuj.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws
```

You'll see Drizzle Studio started in a tab called **Studio**. And a tunnel in the **Tunnel** tab.

---

## 3. Create a schema

Let's define our Drizzle config. Add a `drizzle.config.ts` in your project root with this.

```ts title="drizzle.config.ts" {6-8}
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  dialect: "postgresql",
  // Pick up all our schema files
  schema: ["./src/**/*.sql.ts"],
  out: "./migrations",
  dbCredentials: {
    host: Resource.MyPostgres.host,
    port: Resource.MyPostgres.port,
    user: Resource.MyPostgres.username,
    password: Resource.MyPostgres.password,
    database: Resource.MyPostgres.database,
  },
});
```

Here we are telling Drizzle that we'll be specifying your database schema in `.sql.ts` files in our `src/` directory.

:::tip
SST allows us to automatically access our database with `Resource.MyPostgres.*`.
:::

We are going to create a simple database to store some todos. Create a new file in `src/todo.sql.ts` with the following.

```ts title="src/todo.sql.ts"
import { text, serial, pgTable } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const todo = pgTable("todo", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  title: text("title").notNull(),
  description: text("description"),
});
```

---

## 4. Generate a migration

We can use this to generate a migration.

```bash
npm run db generate
```

This in turn runs `sst shell drizzle-kit generate` and creates a new migration in the `migrations/` directory.

---

#### Apply the migration

Now we can apply our migration using.

```bash
npm run db migrate
```

This should create our new schema.

:::tip
You need a tunnel to connect to your database.
:::

This needs the tunnel to connect to the database. So you should have `sst dev` in a separate terminal.

```bash "sudo"
npx sst tunnel
```

Alternatively, you can just run the tunnel using the above command.

---

#### Drizzle Studio

To see our schema in action we can open the Drizzle Studio. Head over to the **Studio** tab in your `sst dev` session and go to the link.

Or head over to `https://local.drizzle.studio` in your browser.

---

## 5. Query the database

To use Drizzle ORM to query our database, create a new `src/drizzle.ts` config file with the following.

```ts title="src/drizzle.ts"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";
import { Pool } from "pg";
import { Resource } from "sst";
import * as schema from "./todo.sql";

const pool = new Pool({
  host: Resource.MyPostgres.host,
  port: Resource.MyPostgres.port,
  user: Resource.MyPostgres.username,
  password: Resource.MyPostgres.password,
  database: Resource.MyPostgres.database,
});

export const db = drizzle(pool, { schema });
```

Now we can use that in the API. Create our API handler in `src/api.ts`.

```ts title="src/api.ts"
import { db } from "./drizzle";
import { todo } from "./todo.sql";
import { APIGatewayProxyEventV2 } from "aws-lambda";

export const handler = async (evt: APIGatewayProxyEventV2) => {
  if (evt.requestContext.http.method === "GET") {
    const result = await db.select().from(todo).execute();

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify(result, null, 2),
    };
  }

  if (evt.requestContext.http.method === "POST") {
    const result = await db
      .insert(todo)
      .values({ title: "Todo", description: crypto.randomUUID() })
      .returning()
      .execute();

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify(result),
    };
  }
};
```

For _POST_ requests we create a new todo and for _GET_ requests we simply print out all our todos.

---

#### Test your app

To test our app, make a _POST_ request to our API.

```bash
curl -X POST https://ouu5vovpxllyn5b6ot2nn6vdsa0hvcuj.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws
```

Now if you head over to `https://ouu5vovpxllyn5b6ot2nn6vdsa0hvcuj.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws` in your browser, you'll see that a todo has been added.

![Todo created with Drizzle in SST](../../../../../assets/docs/start/todo-created-with-drizzle-in-sst.png)

You should see this in the Drizzle Studio as well.

---

## 6. Deploy your app

Finally, let's deploy your app.

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production.

---

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can setup the [SST Console](/docs/console/) to _**git push to deploy**_ your app and monitor it for any issues. 

![SST Console Autodeploy](../../../../../assets/docs/start/sst-console-autodeploy.png)

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
