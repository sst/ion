title: Remix on AWS with SST
description: Create and deploy a Remix app to AWS with SST.
---

We are going to create a Remix app, add an S3 Bucket for file uploads, and deploy it to AWS using SST.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-remix) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started:

1. [Configure your AWS credentials](https://docs.sst.dev/advanced/iam-credentials#loading-from-a-file)
2. [Install the SST CLI](/docs/reference/cli)

---

## 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our project.

```bash
npx create-remix@latest
cd aws-remix
```

#### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app. Make sure you have the [CLI installed](/docs/reference/cli/).

```bash
sst init
```

This'll detect that you are in a Remix project and create a `sst.config.ts` file in the root.

#### Start dev mode

Start the dev mode for your Remix app and link it to SST.

```bash
npm run dev
```

:::note
You are starting `remix vite:dev` wrapped in `sst dev remix vite:dev`.
:::

---

## 2. Add an S3 Bucket

Let's add a `public` S3 Bucket for file uploads. Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket", {
  public: true
});
```

#### Link the bucket

Now, link the bucket to our Remix app.

```js title="sst.config.ts" {2}
new sst.aws.Remix("MyWeb", {
  link: [bucket],
});
```

---

## 3. Create an upload form

Add the upload form client in `app/routes/_index.tsx`. Replace the `Index` component with:

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
export default function Index() {
  const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();
  return (
    <div style={{ fontFamily: "system-ui, sans-serif", lineHeight: "1.8" }}>
      <h1>Welcome to Remix</h1>
      <form
        onSubmit={async (e) => {
          e.preventDefault();

          const file = (e.target as HTMLFormElement).file.files?.[0]!;

          const image = await fetch(data.url, {
            body: file,
            method: "PUT",
            headers: {
              "Content-Type": file.type,
              "Content-Disposition": `attachment; filename="${file.name}"`,
            },
          });

          window.location.href = image.url.split("?")[0];
        }}
      >
        <input name="file" type="file" accept="image/png, image/jpeg" />
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## 4. Generate a pre-signed URL

When our app loads, we'll generate a pre-signed URL for the file upload and use it in the form.

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx" {4}
export async function loader() {
  const command = new PutObjectCommand({
    Key: crypto.randomUUID(),
    Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
  });
  const url = await getSignedUrl(new S3Client({}), command);

  return json({ url });
}
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our S3 bucket with `Resource.MyBucket.name`.
:::

Add the relevant imports.

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { json } from "@remix-run/node";
import { useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
```

And install the npm packages.

```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

Head over to the local Remix app in your browser, `http://localhost:5173` and try **uploading an image**. You should see it upload and then download the image.

---

## 5. Deploy your app

Now let's deploy your app to AWS.

```bash
sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production.

Congrats! Your site should now be live!

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can setup the [SST Console](/docs/console/) to _**git push to deploy**_ your app and monitor it for any issues.

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
