title: Bun on AWS with SST
description: Create and deploy a Bun app to AWS with SST.
---

We are going to build a hit counter using Bun and Redis. We'll the deploy it to AWS in a container using SST.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-bun) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](/docs/iam-credentials#credentials).

---

## 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our Bun app.

```bash
mkdir aws-bun && cd aws-bun
bun init -y
```

---

#### Init Bun Serve

Replace your `index.ts` with the following.

```js title="index.ts"
const server = Bun.serve({
  async fetch(req) {
    const url = new URL(req.url);

    if (url.pathname === "/" && req.method === "GET") {
      return new Response("Hello World!");
    }

    return new Response("404!");
  },
});

console.log(`Listening on ${server.url}`);
```

This starts up an HTTP server by default on port `3000`.

---

#### Add scripts

Add the following to your `package.json`.

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "dev": "bun run --watch index.ts",
  "build": "bun build --target bun index.ts"
},
```

This adds a `dev` script with a watcher and a `build` script that we'll use later.

---

#### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app.

```bash
bunx sst init
bun install
```

This'll create an `sst.config.ts` file in your project root and install SST.

---

## 2. Add a Cluster

To deploy our Bun app, let's add an [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) container with [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts" {9-11}
async run() {
  const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc", { bastion: true });
  const cluster = new sst.aws.Cluster("MyCluster", { vpc });

  cluster.addService("MyService", {
    public: {
      ports: [{ listen: "80/http", forward: "3000/http" }],
    },
    dev: {
      command: "bun dev",
    },
  });
}
```

This creates a VPC with a bastion host, an ECS Cluster, and adds a Fargate service to it.

The `dev.command` tells SST to run our Bun app locally in dev mode.

---

## 3. Add Redis

Let's add an [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) Redis cluster. Add this below the `Vpc` component in your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const redis = new sst.aws.Redis("MyRedis", { vpc });
```

This shares the same VPC as our ECS cluster.

---

#### Link Redis

Now, link the Redis cluster to the container.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
cluster.addService("MyService", {
  // ...
  link: [redis],
});
```

This will allow us to reference the Redis cluster in our Bun app.

---

#### Install a tunnel

Since our Redis cluster is in a VPC, we'll need a tunnel to connect to it from our local machine.

```bash "sudo"
sudo bun sst tunnel install
```

This needs _sudo_ to create a network interface on your machine. You'll only need to do this once on your machine.

---

#### Start dev mode

Start your app in dev mode.

```bash
bun sst dev
```

This will deploy your app, start a tunnel in the **Tunnel** tab, and run your Bun app locally in the **MyServiceDev** tab.

---

## 4. Connect to Redis

We want the `/` route of our API to increment a counter in our Redis cluster. Let's start by installing the npm package we'll use.

```bash
bun install ioredis
```

Add the relevant imports to your `index.ts`.

```ts title="index.ts" {5}
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { Cluster } from "ioredis";

const redis = new Cluster(
  [{ host: Resource.MyRedis.host, port: Resource.MyRedis.port }],
  {
    dnsLookup: (address, callback) => callback(null, address),
    redisOptions: {
      tls: {},
      username: Resource.MyRedis.username,
      password: Resource.MyRedis.password,
    },
  }
);
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our Redis cluster with `Resource.MyRedis.*`.
:::

Let's update the `/` route.

```ts title="index.tjs"
if (url.pathname === "/" && req.method === "GET") {
  const counter = await redis.incr("counter");
  return new Response(`Hit counter: ${counter}`);
}
```

---

#### Test your app

Let's head over to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and it'll show the current hit counter.

You should see it increment every time you refresh the page.

---

## 5. Deploy your app

To deploy our app we'll first add a `Dockerfile`. This is building our app by running our `build` script from above.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile" {27}
# use the official Bun image
# see all versions at https://hub.docker.com/r/oven/bun/tags
FROM oven/bun:1 AS base
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# install dependencies into temp directory
# this will cache them and speed up future builds
FROM base AS install
RUN mkdir -p /temp/dev
COPY package.json bun.lockb /temp/dev/
RUN cd /temp/dev && bun install --frozen-lockfile

# install with --production (exclude devDependencies)
RUN mkdir -p /temp/prod
COPY package.json bun.lockb /temp/prod/
RUN cd /temp/prod && bun install --frozen-lockfile --production

# copy node_modules from temp directory
# then copy all (non-ignored) project files into the image
FROM base AS prerelease
COPY --from=install /temp/dev/node_modules node_modules
COPY . .

# [optional] tests & build
ENV NODE_ENV=production
# RUN bun test
RUN bun run build

# copy production dependencies and source code into final image
FROM base AS release
COPY --from=install /temp/prod/node_modules node_modules
COPY --from=prerelease /usr/src/app/index.ts .
COPY --from=prerelease /usr/src/app/package.json .

# run the app
USER bun
EXPOSE 3000/tcp
ENTRYPOINT [ "bun", "run", "index.ts" ]
```

This is pretty much the same setup from the [Bun docs](https://bun.sh/guides/ecosystem/docker). We are just skipping running the tests.

:::tip
You need to be running [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to deploy your app.
:::

Let's also add a `.dockerignore` file in the root.

```bash title=".dockerignore"
node_modules
.git
.gitignore
README.md
Dockerfile*
```

Now to build our Docker image and deploy we run:

```bash
bun sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production. This'll give the URL of your Bun app deployed as a Fargate service.

```bash
âœ“  Complete
   MyService: http://prod-MyServiceLoadBalanc-491430065.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can setup the [SST Console](/docs/console/) to _**git push to deploy**_ your app and monitor it for any issues. 

![SST Console Autodeploy](../../../../../assets/docs/start/sst-console-autodeploy.png)

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
