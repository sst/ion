title: Hono on AWS with SST
description: Create and deploy a Hono API in AWS with SST.
---

We are going to build a serverless [Hono](https://hono.dev) API, add an S3 Bucket for file uploads, and deploy it to AWS using SST.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-hono) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started:

1. [Configure your AWS credentials](https://docs.sst.dev/advanced/iam-credentials#loading-from-a-file)
2. [Install the SST CLI](/docs/reference/cli)

---

## 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our app.

```bash
mkdir my-hono-app && cd my-hono-app
npm init -y
```
> use `npm i sst@ion`, please refer https://ion.sst.dev/docs/reference/sdk/#installation
#### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app. Make sure you have the [CLI installed](/docs/reference/cli/).

```bash
sst init
```

This'll create a `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

---

## 2. Add an API

Let's add a Hono API using an AWS Lambda. Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
async run() {
  const hono = new sst.aws.Function("Hono", {
    url: true,
    handler: "index.handler",
  });

  return {
    api: hono.url,
  };
}
```

We are enabling the function URL for this.

#### Start dev mode

Start your app in dev mode. This runs your functions [_Live_](/docs/live/).

```bash
sst dev
```

This will give you the URL of your API.

```bash frame="none"
âœ”  Complete
   api: https://gyrork2ll35rsuml2yr4lifuqu0tsjft.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws
```

---

## 3. Add an S3 Bucket

Let's add a `public` S3 Bucket for file uploads. Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket", {
  public: true
});
```

#### Link the bucket

Now, link the bucket to the API.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
const hono = new sst.aws.Function("Hono", {
  url: true,
  link: [bucket],
  handler: "index.handler",
});
```

---

## 4. Upload a file

We want the `/` route of our API to generate a pre-signed URL to upload a file to our S3 Bucket. Create an `index.ts` file and add the following.

```ts title="index.ts" {5}
const app = new Hono()
  .get("/", async (c) => {
    const command = new PutObjectCommand({
      Key: crypto.randomUUID(),
      Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
    });

    return c.text(await getSignedUrl(s3, command));
  });

export const handler = handle(app);
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our S3 bucket with `Resource.MyBucket.name`.
:::

Add the relevant imports.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";
import {
  S3Client,
  GetObjectCommand,
  PutObjectCommand,
  ListObjectsV2Command,
} from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { handle } from "hono/aws-lambda";

const s3 = new S3Client({});
```

And install the npm packages.

```bash
npm install hono @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

---

## 5. Download a file

We want the `/latest` route of our API to generate a pre-signed URL to download the last uploaded file in our S3 Bucket. Add this to your routes in `index.ts`.

```ts title="index.ts"
const app = new Hono()
  // ...
  .get("/latest", async (c) => {
    const objects = await s3.send(
      new ListObjectsV2Command({
        Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
      }),
    );

    const latestFile = objects.Contents!.sort(
      (a, b) =>
        (b.LastModified?.getTime() ?? 0) - (a.LastModified?.getTime() ?? 0),
    )[0];

    const command = new GetObjectCommand({
      Key: latestFile.Key,
      Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
    });

    return c.redirect(await getSignedUrl(s3, command));
  });
```

---

#### Test your app

Let's try uploading a file from your project root. Make sure to use your API URL.

```bash
curl --upload-file package.json "$(curl https://gyrork2ll35rsuml2yr4lifuqu0tsjft.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws)"
```

Now head over to `https://gyrork2ll35rsuml2yr4lifuqu0tsjft.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/latest` in your browser and it'll download the file you just uploaded.

---

## 6. Deploy your app

Now let's deploy your app.

```bash
sst deploy
```

---

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can manage your app and view issues in the [SST Console](/docs/console/).

![Issues in Hono API app in SST Console](../../../../../assets/docs/start/issues-in-hono-api-app-in-the-sst-console.png)

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
