title: Containers on AWS with SST
description: Create and deploy a container to AWS with SST.
---

We are going to build Express app in a container, add an S3 Bucket for file uploads, and deploy it to AWS using SST.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-cluster) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](https://docs.sst.dev/advanced/iam-credentials#loading-from-a-file).

---

## 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our Express app.

```bash
mkdir my-express-app && cd my-express-app
npm init -y
npm install express
```

---

#### Init Express

Create your app by adding an `index.mjs` to the root.

```js title="index.mjs"
import express from "express";

const PORT = 80;

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!")
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

---

#### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app.

```bash
npx sst init
npm install
```

This'll create a `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

---

## 2. Add a Cluster

To deploy our Express app, let's add an [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) container with [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts" {11-13}
async run() {
  const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc");

  const cluster = new sst.aws.Cluster("MyCluster", { vpc });

  cluster.addService("MyService", {
    public: {
      ports: [
        { listen: "80/http" },
      ],
      dev: {
        command: "node --watch index.mjs",
      },
    },
  });
}
```

This creates a VPC, uses it for a new ECS Cluster, adds a Fargate service to it, and exposes it through _http_.

The `dev.command` tells SST to run our Express app locally in dev mode.

---

#### Create a Dockerfile

Let's add a `Dockerfile` in the root with the following.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM node:18-bullseye-slim

WORKDIR /app/

COPY package.json /app
RUN npm install

COPY index.mjs /app

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "index.mjs"]
```

---

## 3. Add an S3 Bucket

Let's add a `public` S3 Bucket for file uploads. Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket", {
  public: true
});
```

#### Link the bucket

Now, link the bucket to the container service.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
cluster.addService("MyService", {
  // ...
  link: [bucket],
});
```

This will allow us to reference the bucket in our Express app.

---

#### Start dev mode

Start your app in dev mode.

```bash
npx sst dev
```

Once complete, click on **MyService** in the sidebar for your local Express app.

---

## 4. Upload a file

We want the `/` route of our API to upload a file to our S3 Bucket. Let's start by installing the npm packages we'll use for the upload.

```bash
npm install multer @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/lib-storage @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

Add the relevant imports.

```ts title="index.ts"
import multer from "multer";
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { Upload } from "@aws-sdk/lib-storage";
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";
import { S3Client, GetObjectCommand, ListObjectsV2Command } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";

const s3 = new S3Client({});
const upload = multer({ storage: multer.memoryStorage() });
```

And add the route to your `index.mjs`.

```ts title="index.mjs" {4}
app.post("/", upload.single("file"), async (req, res) => {
  const file = req.file;
  const params = {
    Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
    Key: file.originalname,
    Body: file.buffer
  };

  const upload = new Upload({
    params,
    client: s3,
  });

  await upload.done();

  res.status(200).send("File uploaded successfully.");
});
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our S3 bucket with `Resource.MyBucket.name`.
:::

---

## 5. Download a file

We want the `/latest` route of our app to generate a pre-signed URL to download the last uploaded file in our S3 Bucket. Add this to your `index.mjs`.

```ts title="index.mjs"
app.get("/latest", async (req, res) => {
  const objects = await s3.send(
    new ListObjectsV2Command({
      Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
    })
  );

  const latestFile = objects.Contents.sort((a, b) => b.LastModified - a.LastModified)[0];

  const command = new GetObjectCommand({
    Key: latestFile.Key,
    Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
  });
  const url = await getSignedUrl(s3, command);

  res.redirect(url);
});
```

---

#### Test your app

Let's try uploading a file from your project root.

```bash
curl -F file=@package.json http://localhost:80
```

Now head over to `http://localhost:80/latest` in your browser and it'll download the file you just uploaded.

---

## 6. Deploy your app

Now let's deploy your app.

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production. This'll give the URL of your Express app deployed as a Fargate service.

```bash
+  Complete
   MyService: http://jayair-MyServiceLoadBala-592628062.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

---

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can setup the [SST Console](/docs/console/) to _**git push to deploy**_ your app and monitor it for any issues. 

![SST Console Autodeploy](../../../../../assets/docs/start/sst-console-autodeploy.png)

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
