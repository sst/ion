title: Express on AWS with SST
description: Create and deploy an Express app to AWS with SST.
---

We are going to build a hit counter using Express and Redis. We'll the deploy it to AWS in a container using SST.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-express) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](/docs/iam-credentials#credentials).

---

## 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our Express app.

```bash
mkdir aws-express && cd aws-express
npm init -y
npm install express
```

---

#### Init Express

Create your app by adding an `index.mjs` to the root.

```js title="index.mjs"
import express from "express";

const PORT = 80;

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!")
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

---

#### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app.

```bash
npx sst@latest init
npm install
```

This'll create a `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

---

## 2. Add a Cluster

To deploy our Express app, let's add an [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) container with [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts" {9-11}
async run() {
  const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc", { bastion: true });
  const cluster = new sst.aws.Cluster("MyCluster", { vpc });

  cluster.addService("MyService", {
    public: {
      ports: [{ listen: "80/http" }],
    },
    dev: {
      command: "node --watch index.mjs",
    },
  });
}
```

This creates a VPC with a bastion host, an ECS Cluster, and adds a Fargate service to it.

The `dev.command` tells SST to run our Express app locally in dev mode.

---

## 3. Add Redis

Let's add an [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) Redis cluster. Add this below the `Vpc` component in your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const redis = new sst.aws.Redis("MyRedis", { vpc });
```

This shares the same VPC as our ECS cluster.

---

#### Link Redis

Now, link the Redis cluster to the container.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
cluster.addService("MyService", {
  // ...
  link: [redis],
});
```

This will allow us to reference the Redis cluster in our Express app.

---

#### Install a tunnel

Since our Redis cluster is in a VPC, we'll need a tunnel to connect to it from our local machine.

```bash "sudo"
sudo npx sst tunnel install
```

This needs _sudo_ to create a network interface on your machine. You'll only need to do this once on your machine.

---

#### Start dev mode

Start your app in dev mode.

```bash
npx sst dev
```

This will deploy your app, start a tunnel in the **Tunnel** tab, and run your Express app locally in the **MyServiceDev** tab.

---

## 4. Connect to Redis

We want the `/` route of our API to increment a counter in our Redis cluster. Let's start by installing the npm package we'll use.

```bash
npm install ioredis
```

Add the relevant imports to your `index.mjs`.

```ts title="index.mjs" {5}
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { Cluster } from "ioredis";

const redis = new Cluster(
  [{ host: Resource.MyRedis.host, port: Resource.MyRedis.port }],
  {
    dnsLookup: (address, callback) => callback(null, address),
    redisOptions: {
      tls: {},
      username: Resource.MyRedis.username,
      password: Resource.MyRedis.password,
    },
  }
);
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our Redis cluster with `Resource.MyRedis.*`.
:::

Let's update the `/` route.

```ts title="index.mjs"
app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  const counter = await redis.incr("counter");
  res.send(`Hit counter: ${counter}`);
});
```

---

#### Test your app

Let's head over to `http://localhost:80` in your browser and it'll show the current hit counter.

You should see it increment every time you refresh the page.

---

## 5. Deploy your app

To deploy our app we'll first add a `Dockerfile`.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM node:18-bullseye-slim

WORKDIR /app/

COPY package.json /app
RUN npm install

COPY index.mjs /app

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "index.mjs"]
```

This just builds our Express app in a Docker image.

:::tip
You need to be running [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to deploy your app.
:::

Let's also add a `.dockerignore` file in the root.

```bash title=".dockerignore"
node_modules
```

Now to build our Docker image and deploy we run:

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production. This'll give the URL of your Express app deployed as a Fargate service.

```bash
âœ“  Complete
   MyService: http://jayair-MyServiceLoadBala-592628062.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

---

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can setup the [SST Console](/docs/console/) to _**git push to deploy**_ your app and monitor it for any issues. 

![SST Console Autodeploy](../../../../../assets/docs/start/sst-console-autodeploy.png)

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
