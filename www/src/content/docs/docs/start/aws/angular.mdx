title: Angular on AWS with SST
description: Create and deploy an Angular app to AWS with SST.
---

We are going to create an Angular 18 SPA, add an S3 Bucket for file uploads, and deploy it to AWS using SST.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-angular) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](/docs/iam-credentials#credentials).

---

## 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our project.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new aws-angular
cd aws-angular
```

We are picking **CSS** for styles, and **not using SSR**.

---

#### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app.

```bash
npx sst@latest init
```

This'll create a `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

---

## 2. Add an S3 Bucket

Let's allow public `access` to our S3 Bucket for file uploads. Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket", {
  access: "public"
});
```

Add this above the `StaticSite` component.

We are going to upload a file to this bucket using a pre-signed URL. This'll let us upload it directly to our bucket.

---

## 3. Add an API 

Let's create a simple API to generate that URL. Add this below the `Bucket` component.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
const pre = new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  url: true,
  link: [bucket],
  handler: "functions/presigned.handler",
});
```

We are linking our bucket to this function.

---

#### Pass the API URL

Now, pass the API URL to our Angular app. Add this below the `build` prop in our `StaticSite` component.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {2}
environment: {
  NG_APP_PRESIGNED_API: pre.url
}
```

To load this in our Angular app, we'll use the [`@ngx-env/builder`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngx-env/builder) package.

```bash
ng add @ngx-env/builder
```

---

#### Start dev mode

Run the following to start dev mode. This'll start SST and your Angular app.

```bash
npx sst dev
```

Once complete, click on **MyWeb** in the sidebar and go to your Angular app in your browser. Typically on `http://localhost:4200`.


---

## 3. Create an upload form

Let's create a component to do the file upload. Add the following to `src/app/file-upload.component.ts`.

```ts title="src/app/file-upload.component.ts" {19}
import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-file-upload',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [FormsModule],
  template: `
    <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit($event)">
      <input type="file" name="file">
      <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
  `,
})
export class FileUploadComponent {
  private http = inject(HttpClient);

  presignedApi = import.meta.env['NG_APP_PRESIGNED_API'];

  async onSubmit(event: Event): Promise<void> {
    const file = (event.target as HTMLFormElement)['file'].files?.[0]!;

    this.http.get(this.presignedApi, { responseType: 'text' }).subscribe({
      next: async (url: string) => {
        const image = await fetch(url, {
          body: file,
          method: "PUT",
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": file.type,
            "Content-Disposition": `attachment; filename="${file.name}"`,
          },
        });

        window.location.href = image.url.split("?")[0];
      },
    });
  }
}
```

This is getting the pre-signed API URL from the environment. Making a request to it to get the pre-signed URL and then uploading our file to it.

Let's add some `styles` below the `template` prop.

```ts title="src/app/file-upload.component.ts"
styles: [`
  form {
    color: white;
    padding: 2rem;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between;
    background-color: #23262d;
    background-image: none;
    background-size: 400%;
    border-radius: 0.6rem;
    background-position: 100%;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 2px 4px -2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  }
  button {
    appearance: none;
    border: 0;
    font-weight: 500;
    border-radius: 5px;
    font-size: 0.875rem;
    padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem;
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
  }
  button:active:enabled {
    background-color: #EEE;
  }
`]
```

To make HTTP fetch requests we need to add the provider to our Angular app config. Add the following to the `providers` list in `src/app/app.config.ts`.

```ts title="src/app/app.config.ts"
provideHttpClient(withFetch())
```

And import it at the top.

```ts title="src/app/app.config.ts"
import { provideHttpClient, withFetch } from '@angular/common/http';
```

Let's add this to our app. Replace the `src/app/app.component.ts` file with.

```ts title="src/app/app.component.ts"
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';
import { FileUploadComponent } from './file-upload.component';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [RouterOutlet, FileUploadComponent],
  template: `
    <main>
      <app-file-upload></app-file-upload>
    </main>
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  `,
  styles: [`
    main {
      margin: auto;
      padding: 1.5rem;
      max-width: 60ch;
    }
  `],
})
export class AppComponent { }
```

---

## 4. Generate a pre-signed URL

Let's implement the API that generates the pre-signed URL. Create a `functions/presigned.ts` file with the following.

```ts title="functions/presigned.ts" {8}
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";

export async function handler() {
  const command = new PutObjectCommand({
    Key: crypto.randomUUID(),
    Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
  });

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: await getSignedUrl(new S3Client({}), command),
  };
}
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our S3 bucket with `Resource.MyBucket.name`.
:::

And install the npm packages.

```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

Head over to the local Angular app in your browser, `http://localhost:4200` and try **uploading an image**. You should see it upload and then download the image.

---

## 5. Deploy your app

Now let's deploy your app to AWS.

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production.

---

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can setup the [SST Console](/docs/console/) to _**git push to deploy**_ your app and monitor it for any issues. 

![SST Console Autodeploy](../../../../../assets/docs/start/sst-console-autodeploy.png)

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
