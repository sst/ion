title: SvelteKit on AWS with SST
description: Create and deploy a SvelteKit app to AWS with SST.
---

There are two ways to deploy a SvelteKit app to AWS with SST.

1. [Serverless](#serverless)
2. [Containers](#containers)

We'll use both to build a couple of simple apps below.

---

## Serverless

We are going to create a SvelteKit app, add an S3 Bucket for file uploads, and deploy it using the `SvelteKit` component.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-svelte-kit) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](/docs/iam-credentials#credentials).

---

### 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our app.

```bash
npm create svelte@latest aws-svelte
cd aws-svelte
```

We are picking the **_Skeleton project_** and **_Yes, using TypeScript syntax_** options.

---

##### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app.

```bash
npx sst@latest init
npm install
```

Select the defaults and pick **AWS**. This'll create a `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

It'll also ask you to update your `svelte.config.mjs` with something like this.

```diff lang="js" title="svelte.config.mjs"
- import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-auto';
+ import adapter from "svelte-kit-sst";
```

---

##### Start dev mode

Run the following to start dev mode. This'll start SST and your SvelteKit app.

```bash
npx sst dev
```

Once complete, click on **MyWeb** in the sidebar and open your SvelteKit app in your browser.

---

### 2. Add an S3 Bucket

Let's allow public `access` to our S3 Bucket for file uploads. Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket", {
  access: "public"
});
```

Add this above the `SvelteKit` component.

##### Link the bucket

Now, link the bucket to our SvelteKit app.

```js title="sst.config.ts" {2}
new sst.aws.SvelteKit("MyWeb", {
  link: [bucket]
});
```

---

### 3. Create an upload form

Let's add a file upload form. Replace your `src/routes/+page.svelte`. This will upload a file to a given pre-signed upload URL.

```svelte title="src/routes/+page.svelte"
<script>
  /** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */
  export let data;

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    const formData = new FormData(e.target);
    const file = formData.get("file");

    const image = await fetch(data.url, {
      body: file,
      method: "PUT",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": file.type,
        "Content-Disposition": `attachment; filename="${file.name}"`,
      },
    });

    window.location.href = image.url.split("?")[0];
  };
</script>

<section>
  <form on:submit|preventDefault={handleSubmit}>
    <input name="file" type="file" accept="image/png, image/jpeg" />
    <button type="submit">Upload</button>
  </form>
</section>
```

Add some styles.

```css title="src/routes/+page.svelte"
<style>
  section {
    flex: 0.6;
    display: flex;
    padding-top: 4rem;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
  }
</style>
```

---

### 4. Generate a pre-signed URL

When our route loads, we'll generate a pre-signed URL for S3 and our form will upload to it. Create a new `+page.server.ts` and add the following.

```ts title="src/routes/+page.server.ts" {5}
/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */
export async function load() {
  const command = new PutObjectCommand({
    Key: crypto.randomUUID(),
    Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
  });
  const url = await getSignedUrl(new S3Client({}), command);

  return { url };
}
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our S3 bucket with `Resource.MyBucket.name`.
:::

Add the relevant imports.

```ts title="src/routes/+page.server.ts"
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";

```

And install the npm packages.

```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

Head over to the local SvelteKit app in your browser, `http://localhost:5173` and try **uploading an image**. You should see it upload and then download the image.

---

### 5. Deploy your app

Now let's deploy your app to AWS.

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production.

Congrats! Your app should now be live!

---

## Containers

We are going to build a hit counter SvelteKit app with Redis. We'll deploy it to AWS in a container using the `Cluster` component.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-svelte-container) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](/docs/iam-credentials#credentials).

---

### 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our project.

```bash
npm create svelte@latest aws-svelte-container
cd aws-svelte-container
```

We are picking the **_Skeleton project_** and **_Yes, using TypeScript syntax_** options.

---

##### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app.

```bash
npx sst@latest init
npm install
```

Select the defaults and pick **AWS**. This'll create a `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

It'll also ask you to update your `svelte.config.mjs`. But we'll instead use the [**Node.js adapter**](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node) since we're deploying it through a container.

```bash
npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-node
```

And updating your `svelte.config.js`.

```js title="svelte.config.js"
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';

export default {
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter()
  }
};
```

---

### 2. Add a Cluster

To deploy our SvelteKit app in a container, we'll use [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) with [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). Replace the `run` function in your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts" {9-11}
async run() {
  const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc", { bastion: true });
  const cluster = new sst.aws.Cluster("MyCluster", { vpc });

  cluster.addService("MyService", {
    public: {
      ports: [{ listen: "80/http", forward: "3000/http" }],
    },
    dev: {
      command: "npm run dev",
    },
  });
}
```

This creates a VPC with a bastion host, an ECS Cluster, and adds a Fargate service to it.

The `dev.command` tells SST to run our SvelteKit app locally in dev mode.

---

### 3. Add Redis

Let's add an [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) Redis cluster. Add this below the `Vpc` component in your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const redis = new sst.aws.Redis("MyRedis", { vpc });
```

This shares the same VPC as our ECS cluster.

---

#### Link Redis

Now, link the Redis cluster to the container.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
cluster.addService("MyService", {
  // ...
  link: [redis],
});
```

This will allow us to reference the Redis cluster in our SvelteKit app.

---

#### Install a tunnel

Since our Redis cluster is in a VPC, we'll need a tunnel to connect to it from our local machine.

```bash "sudo"
sudo npx sst tunnel install
```

This needs _sudo_ to create a network interface on your machine. You'll only need to do this once on your machine.

---

#### Start dev mode

Start your app in dev mode.

```bash
npx sst dev
```

This will deploy your app, start a tunnel in the **Tunnel** tab, and run your SvelteKit app locally in the **MyServiceDev** tab.

---

### 4. Connect to Redis

We want the `/` route to increment a counter in our Redis cluster. Let's start by installing the npm package we'll use.

```bash
npm install ioredis
```

We'll increment the counter when the page loads. Create a new `+page.server.ts` and add the following.

```ts title="src/routes/+page.server.ts" {5}
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { Cluster } from "ioredis";

const redis = new Cluster(
	[{ host: Resource.MyRedis.host, port: Resource.MyRedis.port }],
	{
		dnsLookup: (address, callback) => callback(null, address),
		redisOptions: {
			tls: {},
			username: Resource.MyRedis.username,
			password: Resource.MyRedis.password,
		},
	}
);

/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */
export async function load() {
	const counter = await redis.incr("counter");

	return { counter };
}
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our Redis cluster with `Resource.MyRedis.*`.
:::

Let's update our page to show the counter. Replace the `src/routes/+page.svelte` component.

```svelte title="src/routes/+page.svelte"
<script>
  /** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */
  export let data;
</script>

<h1>Hit counter: {data.counter}</h1>
```

---

#### Test your app

Let's head over to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser and it'll show the current hit counter.

You should see it increment every time you **refresh the page**.

---

### 5. Deploy your app

To deploy our app we'll add a `Dockerfile`.

<details>
<summary>View Dockerfile</summary>

```diff lang="dockerfile" title="Dockerfile"
FROM node:18.18.0-alpine AS builder

+# Add linked resources to the environment
+ARG SST_RESOURCE_MyRedis

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json .

RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build
RUN npm prune --prod

FROM builder AS deployer

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /app/build build/
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json .

EXPOSE 3000

ENV NODE_ENV=production

CMD [ "node", "build" ]
```

</details>

This builds our SvelteKit app in a Docker image. To make sure that the build process in Docker has access to our Redis cluster, we have the following.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile" "MyRedis"
# Add linked resources to the environment
ARG SST_RESOURCE_MyRedis
```

Here `MyRedis` is the name of the component in our `sst.config.ts` file.

:::tip
You need to be running [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to deploy your app.
:::

Let's also add a `.dockerignore` file in the root.

```bash title=".dockerignore"
.DS_Store
node_modules
```

Now to build our Docker image and deploy we run:

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production.

Congrats! Your app should now be live!

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can setup the [SST Console](/docs/console/) to _**git push to deploy**_ your app and monitor it for any issues. 

![SST Console Autodeploy](../../../../../assets/docs/start/sst-console-autodeploy.png)

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
