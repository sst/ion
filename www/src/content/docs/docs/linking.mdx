Resource linking is a feature of SST that allows you to link resources together and access them in a typesafe and secure way.

1. Create a resource that you want to link to. For example, a bucket.

   ```js {6,11}
   const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
   ```

2. Link it to your function or frontend, using the `link` prop.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Next.js">
     ```js {2}
     new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", {
       link: [bucket]
     });
     ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Remix">
     ```js {2}
     new sst.aws.Remix("MyWeb", {
       link: [bucket]
     });
     ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Astro">
     ```js {2}
     new sst.aws.Astro("MyWeb", {
       link: [bucket]
     });
     ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Function">
     ```js {3}
     new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
       handler: "src/lambda.handler",
       link: [bucket]
     });
     ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. Use the [SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/) to access the linked resource in a typesafe way.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Next.js">
     ```js title="app/page.tsx"
     import { Resource } from "sst";

     console.log(Resource.MyBucket.name);
     ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Remix">
     ```js title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
     import { Resource } from "sst";

     console.log(Resource.MyBucket.name);
     ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Astro">
     ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
     ---
     import { Resource } from "sst";

     console.log(Resource.MyBucket.name);
     ---
     ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Function">
     ```js title="src/lambda.ts"
     import { Resource } from "sst";

     console.log(Resource.MyBucket.name);
     ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

#### Working locally

The above applies to your app deployed through `sst deploy`. To access linked resources locally you'll need to be running `sst dev`.

For the frontends, you'll need to wrap your frontend in the `sst dev` command.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Next.js">
  ```bash
  sst dev next dev
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Remix">
  ```bash
  sst dev remix dev
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Astro">
  ```bash
  sst dev astro dev
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Function">
  ```bash
  sst dev
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## How it works

At high level when you link a resource to a function or frontend, the following happens:

1. The function is given permission to access the linked resource.

2. The _links_ that the resource exposes are injected into the function package.

   :::tip
   The links a component exposes are listed in its API reference. For example, you can [view a Bucket's links here](/docs/component/aws/bucket/#links).
   :::

3. The types to access these links are generated.

---

### Injecting links

Resource links are injected into your function or frontend package when you run `sst dev` or `sst deploy`. But this is done in a slightly different way for both these cases.

#### Functions

The functions in SST are tree shaken and bundled using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). While bundling, SST injects the resource links into the [`globalThis`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis).

#### Frontends

The frontends are not bundled by SST. Instead, when they are built, SST injects the resource links into the `process.env` object using the prefix `SST_RESOURCE_`.

This is why when you are running your frontend locally, it needs to be wrapped in the `sst dev` command.

---

### Generating types

When you run `sst dev` or `sst deploy`, SST generates the types to access the linked resources. These are generated in a `.sst/types.generated.ts` file.

:::tip
If your types are not automatically getting picked up, make sure there is a `sst-env.d.ts` file in your project root.
:::

This file is referenced using a `sst-env.d.ts` in your project root. The `sst-env.d.ts` should be added when you initialize your app with `sst init`.
