<Section type="about">
The CLI helps you manage your SST apps.

If you are using SST as a part of your Node project, we recommend installing it locally.
```bash "sst@ion"
npm install sst@ion
```
:::caution
You need the `@ion` tag to install the Ion version of SST.
:::
---
If you are not using Node, you can install the CLI globally.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ion.sst.dev/install | bash
```

:::note
The CLI currently supports macOS, Linux, and WSL. Windows support is coming soon.
:::

To install a specific version.

```bash "VERSION=0.0.403"
curl -fsSL https://ion.sst.dev/install | VERSION=0.0.403 bash
```
---
#### With a package manager

You can also use a package manager to install the CLI.

- **macOS**

  The CLI is available via a Homebrew Tap, and as downloadable binary in the [releases](https://github.com/sst/ion/releases/latest).

  ```bash
  brew install sst/tap/sst

  # Upgrade
  brew upgrade sst
  ```

  You might have to run `brew upgrade sst`, before the update.

- **Linux**

  The CLI is available as downloadable binaries in the [releases](https://github.com/sst/ion/releases/latest). Download the `.deb` or `.rpm` and install with `sudo dpkg -i` and `sudo rpm -i`.

  For Arch Linux, it's available in the [aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sst-bin).
---
#### Usage

Once installed you can run the commands using.

```bash
sst [command]
```

The CLI takes a few global flags. For example, the deploy command takes the `--stage` flag

```bash
sst deploy --stage production
```
---
#### Environment variables

You can access any environment variables set in the CLI in your `sst.config.ts` file. For example, running:

```bash
ENV_VAR=123 sst deploy
```

Will let you access `ENV_VAR` through `process.env.ENV_VAR`.
</Section>

## Global Flags

### stage
<Segment>
<Section type="parameters">
<InlineSection>
**Type** <code class="primitive">string</code>
</InlineSection>
</Section>
Set the stage the CLI is running on.

```bash frame="none"
sst [command] --stage production
```

The stage is a string that is used to prefix the resources in your app. This allows you to have multiple _environments_ of your app running in the same account.

:::tip
Changing the stage will redeploy your app to a new stage with new resources. The old resources will still be around in the old stage.
:::

If the stage is not passed in, then the CLI will:

1. Use the username on the local machine.
   - If the username is `root`, `admin`, `prod`, `dev`, `production`, then it will prompt for a stage name.
2. Store this in the `.sst/stage` file and reads from it in the future.

This stored stage is called your **personal stage**.
</Segment>

### verbose
<Segment>
<Section type="parameters">
<InlineSection>
**Type** <code class="primitive">boolean</code>
</InlineSection>
</Section>

Enables verbose logging for the CLI output.

```bash
sst [command] --verbose
```

</Segment>

### help
<Segment>
<Section type="parameters">
<InlineSection>
**Type** <code class="primitive">boolean</code>
</InlineSection>
</Section>
Prints help for the given command.

```sh frame="none"
sst [command] --help
```

Or the global help.

```sh frame="none"
sst --help
```
</Segment>

## Commands

### init
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst init
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Flags
- <p><code class="key">yes</code> <code class="primitive">boolean</code></p>
<p>Skip interactive confirmation for detected framework.</p>
</Section>
Initialize a new project in the current directory. This will create a `sst.config.ts` and `sst install` your providers.

If this is run in a Next.js, Remix, Astro, or SvelteKit project, it'll init SST in drop-in mode.

To skip the interactive confirmation after detecting the framework.

```bash frame="none"
sst init --yes
```
</Segment>

### dev
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst dev [command]
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">command?</code></p>
<p>The command to run</p>
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Flags
- <p><code class="key">mode</code> <code class="symbol">&ldquo;</code><code class="primitive">basic</code><code class="symbol">&rdquo;</code><code class="symbol"> | </code><code class="symbol">&ldquo;</code><code class="primitive">mosaic</code><code class="symbol">&rdquo;</code></p>
<p>Defaults to using the multiplexer or `mosaic` mode. Use `basic` to turn it off.</p>
</Section>
Run your app in dev mode.

```bash frame="none"
sst dev
```
By default, this starts a multiplexer with processes that deploy your app, run your functions, or start your frontend.

![sst dev multiplexer mode](../../../../assets/docs/cli/sst-dev-multiplexer-mode.png)

You can navigate to these panes through the sidebar. These include panes that:

1. Watch your `sst.config.ts` and deploy your app
2. Run your functions [Live](/docs/live/) and logs their invocations
3. Start processes for components that have `dev.autostart` enabled
   - Components like `Service` and frontends like `Nextjs`, `Remix`, `Astro`, `StaticSite`, etc.
   - These components are not deployed
   - Instead their `dev.command` is run as a process
   - And loads any [linked resources](/docs/linking) in the environment

The multiplexer makes it so that you won't have to start your frontend or
your container applications separately.

:::tip
The `sst dev` CLI also starts your frontend. So you don't need to start it
separately.
:::

Optionally, you can disable the multiplexer and run `sst dev` in basic mode.

```bash frame="none"
sst dev --mode=basic
```

This will only deploy your app and run your functions. If you are coming from SST
v2, this is how `sst dev` used to work.

However in `basic` mode, you'll need to start your frontend separately by running
`sst dev` in a separate terminal session by passing in the command. For example:

```bash frame="none"
sst dev next dev
```

By wrapping your command, it'll load your [linked resources](/docs/linking) in the
environment.

To pass in a flag to the command, use `--`.

```bash frame="none"
sst dev -- next dev --turbo
```
</Segment>

### deploy
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst deploy
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Flags
- <p><code class="key">target</code> <code class="primitive"></code></p>
<p>Comma seperated list of target URNs.</p>
</Section>
Deploy your application. By default, it deploys to your personal stage.

Optionally, deploy your app to a specific stage.

```bash frame="none"
sst deploy --stage production
```
Optionally, deploy specific resources by passing in a list of their URNs.
You can get the URN of a resource from the [Console](/docs/console/#resources).

```bash frame="none"
sst deploy --target urn:pulumi:prod::www::sst:aws:Astro::Astro,urn:pulumi:prod::www::sst:aws:Bucket::Assets
```
</Segment>

### diff
<Segment>

sst diff
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Flags
- <p><code class="key">target</code> <code class="primitive"></code></p>
<p>Comma seperated list of target URNs.</p>
- <p><code class="key">dev</code> <code class="primitive">boolean</code></p>

</Segment>

### add
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst add <provider>
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">provider</code></p>
<p>The provider to add.</p>
</Section>
Adds and installs the given provider. For example,

```bash frame="none"
sst add aws
```

This command will:

1. Installs the package for the AWS provider.
2. Add `aws` to the globals in your `sst.config.ts`.
3. And, add it to your `providers`.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  providers: {
    aws: true
  }
}
```

You can use any provider listed in the [Directory](/docs/providers#directory).

:::note
Running `sst add aws` above is the same as manually adding the provider to your config and running `sst install`.
:::

By default, the latest version of the provider is installed. If you want to use a specific version, you can set it in your config.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  providers: {
    aws: {
      version: "6.27.0"
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip
You'll need to run `sst install` after you update the `providers` in your config.
:::
</Segment>

### install
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst install
```
</Section>
Installs the providers in your `sst.config.ts`. You'll need this command when:

1. You add a new provider to the `providers` or `home` in your config.
2. Or, when you want to install new providers after you `git pull` some changes.

:::tip
The `sst install` command is similar to `npm install`.
:::

Behind the scenes, it installs the packages for your providers and adds the providers to your globals.

If you don't have a version specified for your providers in your `sst.config.ts`, it'll install their latest versions.

### secret
<Segment>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Subcommands
- <p>[<code class="key">set</code>](#secret-set)</p>
- <p>[<code class="key">load</code>](#secret-load)</p>
- <p>[<code class="key">remove</code>](#secret-remove)</p>
- <p>[<code class="key">list</code>](#secret-list)</p>
</Section>
Manage the secrets in your app defined with `sst.Secret`.
</Segment>
<NestedTitle id="secret-set" Tag="h4" parent="secret ">set</NestedTitle>
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst secret set <name> [value]
```
</Section>
<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">name</code></p>
<p>The name of the secret.</p>
- <p><code class="key">value</code></p>
<p>The value of the secret.</p>
</Section>
Set the value of the secret.

The secrets are encrypted and stored in an S3 Bucket in your AWS account. They are also stored in the package of the functions using the secret.

:::tip
If you are not running `sst dev`, you'll need to `sst deploy` to apply the secret.
:::

For example, set the `sst.Secret` called `StripeSecret` to `123456789`.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret set StripeSecret dev_123456789
```

Optionally, set the secret in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret set StripeSecret prod_123456789 --stage production
```

To set something like an RSA key, you can first save it to a file.

```bash frame="none"
cat > tmp.txt <<EOF
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MEgCQQCo9+BpMRYQ/dL3DS2CyJxRF+j6ctbT3/Qp84+KeFhnii7NT7fELilKUSnx
S30WAvQCCo2yU1orfgqr41mM70MBAgMBAAE=
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
EOF
```

Then set the secret from the file.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret set Key -- "$(cat tmp.txt)"
```

And make sure to delete the temp file.

<NestedTitle id="secret-load" Tag="h4" parent="secret ">load</NestedTitle>
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst secret load <file>
```
</Section>
<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">file</code></p>
<p>The file to load the secrets from.</p>
</Section>
Load all the secrets from a file and set them.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret load ./secrets.env
```

The file needs to be in the _dotenv_ or bash format of key-value pairs.

```sh title="secrets.env"
KEY_1=VALUE1
KEY_2=VALUE2
```

Optionally, set the secrets in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret load ./prod.env --stage production
```

```
</Section>
<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">name</code></p>
<p>The name of the secret.</p>
</Section>
Remove a secret.

For example, remove the `sst.Secret` called `StripeSecret`.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst secret remove StripeSecret
```

Optionally, remove a secret in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst secret remove StripeSecret --stage production
```
</Segment>
<NestedTitle id="secret-list" Tag="h4" parent="secret ">list</NestedTitle>

Optionally, list the secrets in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst secret list --stage production
```
</Segment>

### shell
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst shell [command]
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">command?</code></p>
<p>A command to run.</p>
</Section>
Run a command with **all the resources linked** to the environment. This is useful for running scripts against your infrastructure.

For example, let's say you have the following resources in your app.

```js title="sst.config.ts" {5,9}
new sst.aws.Bucket("MyMainBucket");
new sst.aws.Bucket("MyAdminBucket");
```

We can now write a script that'll can access both these resources with the [JS SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/).

```js title="my-script.js" "Resource.MyMainBucket.name" "Resource.MyAdminBucket.name"
import { Resource } from "sst";

console.log(Resource.MyMainBucket.name, Resource.MyAdminBucket.name);
```

And run the script with `sst shell`.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst shell node my-script.js
```

This'll have access to all the buckets from above.

:::tip
Run the command with `--` to pass arguments to it.
:::

To pass arguments into the script, you'll need to prefix it using `--`.

```bash frame="none" frame="none" /--(?!a)/
sst shell -- node my-script.js --arg1 --arg2
```

If no command is passed in, it opens a shell session with the linked resources.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst shell
```

This is useful if you want to run multiple commands, all while accessing the resources in your app.
</Segment>

### remove
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst remove
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Flags
- <p><code class="key">target</code> <code class="primitive">string</code></p>
<p>Comma seperated list of target URNs.</p>
</Section>
Removes your application. By default, it removes your personal stage.

:::tip
The resources in your app are removed based on the `removal` setting in your `sst.config.ts`.
:::

This does not remove the SST _state_ and _bootstrap_ resources in your account as these might still be in use by other apps. You can remove them manually if you want to reset your account, [learn more](docs/providers/#state).

Optionally, remove your app from a specific stage.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst remove --stage production
```
```
Optionally, remove specific resources by passing in a list of their URNs.
You can get the URN of a resource from the [Console](/docs/console/#resources).

```bash frame="none"
sst remove --target urn:pulumi:prod::www::sst:aws:Astro::Astro,urn:pulumi:prod::www::sst:aws:Bucket::Assets
```
</Segment>

### unlock
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst unlock
```
</Section>
When you run `sst deploy`, it acquires a lock on your state file to prevent concurrent deploys.

However, if something unexpectedly kills the `sst deploy` process, or if you manage to run `sst deploy` concurrently, the lock might not be released.

This should not usually happen, but it can prevent you from deploying. You can run `sst unlock` to release the lock.
</Segment>

### version
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst version
```
</Section>
Prints the current version of the CLI.
</Segment>

### upgrade
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst upgrade [version]
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">version?</code></p>
<p>A version to upgrade to.</p>
</Section>
Upgrade the CLI to the latest version. Or optionally, pass in a version to upgrade to.

```bash frame="none"
sst upgrade 0.10
```
</Segment>

### telemetry

#### Subcommands
- <p>[<code class="key">enable</code>](#telemetry-enable)</p>
- <p>[<code class="key">disable</code>](#telemetry-disable)</p>
</Section>
Manage telemetry settings.

SST collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage. We track:
- Version of SST in use
- Command invoked, `sst dev`, `sst deploy`, etc.
- General machine information, like the number of CPUs, OS, CI/CD environment, etc.

This is completely optional and can be disabled at any time.
</Segment>
<NestedTitle id="telemetry-enable" Tag="h4" parent="telemetry ">enable</NestedTitle>

</Section>
Compares your local state with the state of the resources in the cloud provider. Any changes that are found are adopted into your local state. It will:

1. Go through every single resource in your state.
2. Make a call to the cloud provider to check the resource.
   - If the configs are different, it'll **update the state** to reflect the change.
   - If the resource doesn't exist anymore, it'll **remove it from the state**.

:::note
The `sst refresh` does not make changes to the resources in the cloud provider.
:::
Optionally, refresh specific resources by passing in a list of their URNs.
You can get the URN of a resource from the [Console](/docs/console/#resources).

```bash frame="none"
sst refresh --target urn:pulumi:prod::www::sst:aws:Astro::Astro,urn:pulumi:prod::www::sst:aws:Bucket::Assets
```

This is useful for cases where you want to ensure that your local state is in sync with your cloud provider. [Learn more about how state works](/docs/providers/#how-state-works).
