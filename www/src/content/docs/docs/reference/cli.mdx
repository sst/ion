<Section type="about">
The CLI helps you manage your SST apps.

```bash title="Install"
curl -fsSL https://ion.sst.dev/install | bash
```

:::note
The CLI currently supports macOS, Linux, and WSL. Windows support is coming soon.
:::

To install a specific version.

```bash "VERSION=0.0.403"
curl -fsSL https://ion.sst.dev/install | VERSION=0.0.403 bash
```

#### With a package manager

You can also use a package manager to install the CLI.

- **macOS**

  The CLI is available via a Homebrew Tap, and as downloadable binary in the [releases](https://github.com/sst/ion/releases/latest).

  ```bash
  brew install sst/tap/sst

  # Upgrade
  brew upgrade sst
  ```

  You might have to run `brew upgrade sst`, before the update.

- **Linux**

  The CLI is available as downloadable binaries in the [releases](https://github.com/sst/ion/releases/latest). Download the `.deb` or `.rpm` and install with `sudo dpkg -i` and `sudo rpm -i`.

  For Arch Linux, it's available in the [aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sst-bin).

- **Windows**

  The CLI is available via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), and as a downloadable binary in the [releases](https://github.com/sst/ion/releases/latest).

  ```bash
  scoop bucket add sst https://github.com/sst/scoop-bucket.git
  scoop install sst

  # Upgrade
  scoop update sst
  ```

#### Usage

Once installed you can run the commands using.

```bash
sst [command]
```

The CLI takes a few global flags. For example, the deploy command takes the `--stage` flag

```bash
sst deploy --stage=production
```

#### Environment variables

You can access any environment variables set in the CLI in your `sst.config.ts` file. For example, running:

```bash
ENV_VAR=123 sst deploy
```

Will let you access `ENV_VAR` through `process.env.ENV_VAR`.

## Global Flags

### stage
<Segment>
<Section type="parameters">
<InlineSection>
**Type** <code class="primitive">string</code>
</InlineSection>
</Section>
Set the stage the CLI is running on.

```bash frame="none"
sst [command] --stage=production
```

The stage is a string that is used to prefix the resources in your app. This allows you to have multiple _environments_ of your app running in the same account.

:::tip
Changing the stage will redeploy your app to a new stage with new resources. The old resources will still be around in the old stage.
:::

If the stage is not passed in, then the CLI will:

1. Use the username on the local machine.
   - If the username is `root`, `admin`, `prod`, `dev`, `production`, then it will prompt for a stage name.
2. Store this in the `.sst/stage` file and reads from it in the future.

This stored stage is called your **personal stage**.
</Segment>

### verbose
<Segment>
<Section type="parameters">
<InlineSection>
**Type** <code class="primitive">boolean</code>
</InlineSection>
</Section>

Enables verbose logging for the CLI output.

```bash
sst [command] --verbose
```

</Segment>

### help
<Segment>
<Section type="parameters">
<InlineSection>
**Type** <code class="primitive">boolean</code>
</InlineSection>
</Section>
Prints help for the given command.

```sh frame="none"
sst [command] --help
```

Or for the global help.

```sh frame="none"
sst --help
```
</Segment>

## Commands

### init
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst init
```
</Section>
Initialize a new project in the current directory. This will create a `sst.config.ts` and `sst install` your providers.

If this is run in a Next.js, Remix, Astro, or SvelteKit project, it'll init SST in drop-in mode.
</Segment>

### dev
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst dev [command]
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">command?</code></p>
The command to run
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Flags
- <p><code class="key">silent</code> <code class="primitive">boolean</code></p>
Don't show logs from function invocations
</Section>
Run your app in development mode.

```bash frame="none"
sst dev
```

Optionally, pass in a command to start your frontend as well.

```bash frame="none"
sst dev next dev
```

To pass in a flag to your command, wrap it in quotes.

```bash frame="none"
sst dev "next dev --turbo"
```

Dev mode does a few things:

1. Starts a local server
2. Watches your `sst.config.ts` and re-deploys changes
3. Run your functions [Live](/docs/live/)
4. Skip components that should be run locally
   - `Service`
   - Frontends like, `Nextjs`, `Remix`, `Astro`, `SvelteKit`, etc.
5. If you pass in a `command`, it'll:
   - Load your [linked resources](/docs/linking) in the environment
   - And run the command

:::note
If you run `sst dev` with a command, it will not print your function logs.
:::

If `sst dev` starts your frontend, it won't print logs from your SST app. We do this to prevent your logs from being too noisy. To view your logs, you can run `sst dev` in a separate terminal.

:::tip
You can start as many instances of `sst dev` in your app as you want.
:::

Starting multiple instances of `sst dev` in the same project only starts a single _server_. Meaning that the second instance connects to the existing one.

This is different from SST v2, in that you needed to run `sst dev` and `sst bind` for your frontend.
</Segment>

### deploy
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst deploy
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Flags
- <p><code class="key">target</code> <code class="primitive"></code></p>
Comma seperated list of target URNs.
</Section>
Deploy your application. By default, it deploys to your personal stage.

Optionally, deploy your app to a specific stage.

```bash frame="none"
sst deploy --stage=production
```
</Segment>

### add
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst add <provider>
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">provider</code></p>
The provider to add.
</Section>
Adds and installs the given provider. For example,

```bash frame="none"
sst add aws
```

This command will:

1. Installs the package for the AWS provider.
2. Add `aws` to the globals in your `sst.config.ts`.
3. And, add it to your `providers`.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  providers: {
    aws: true
  }
}
```

You can use any provider listed in the [Pulumi Registry](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/).
The name of a provider comes from the **URL of the provider** in the Pulumi Registry.

For example, `https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/aws/` is the URL of the AWS Clasic provider. So the name of the provider here is `aws`.

:::note
Running `sst add aws` above is the same as manually adding the provider to your config and running `sst install`.
:::

By default, the latest version of the provider is installed. If you want to use a specific version, you can set it in your config.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  providers: {
    aws: {
      version: "6.27.0"
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip
You'll need to run `sst install` after you update the `providers` in your config.
:::
</Segment>

### install
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst install
```
</Section>
Installs the providers in your `sst.config.ts`. You'll need this command when:

1. You add a new provider to the `providers` or `home` in your config.
2. Or, when you want to install new providers after you `git pull` some changes.

:::tip
The `sst install` command is similar to `npm install`.
:::

Behind the scenes, it installs the packages for your providers and adds the providers to your globals.

If you don't have a version specified for your providers in your `sst.config.ts`, it'll install their latest versions.
</Segment>

### secret
<Segment>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Subcommands
- <p>[<code class="key">set</code>](#secret-set)</p>
- <p>[<code class="key">load</code>](#secret-load)</p>
- <p>[<code class="key">remove</code>](#secret-remove)</p>
- <p>[<code class="key">list</code>](#secret-list)</p>
</Section>
Manage the secrets in your app defined with `sst.Secret`.
</Segment>
<NestedTitle id="secret-set" Tag="h4" parent="secret ">set</NestedTitle>
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst secret set <name> [value]
```
</Section>
<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">name</code></p>
The name of the secret.
- <p><code class="key">value</code></p>
The value of the secret.
</Section>
Set the value of the secret.

The secrets are encrypted and stored in an S3 Bucket in your AWS account. They are also stored in the package of the functions using the secret.

:::tip
If you are not running `sst dev`, you'll need to `sst deploy` to apply the secret.
:::

For example, set the `sst.Secret` called `StripeSecret` to `123456789`.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret set StripeSecret dev_123456789
```

Optionally, set the secret in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret set StripeSecret prod_123456789 --stage=production
```

To set something like an RSA key, you can first save it to a file.

```bash frame="none"
cat > tmp.txt <<EOF
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MEgCQQCo9+BpMRYQ/dL3DS2CyJxRF+j6ctbT3/Qp84+KeFhnii7NT7fELilKUSnx
S30WAvQCCo2yU1orfgqr41mM70MBAgMBAAE=
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
EOF
```

Then set the secret from the file.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret set Key -- "$(cat tmp.txt)"
```

And make sure to delete the temp file.
</Segment>
<NestedTitle id="secret-load" Tag="h4" parent="secret ">load</NestedTitle>
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst secret load <file>
```
</Section>
<Section type="parameters">

- <p><code class="key">file</code></p>
The file to load the secrets from.
</Section>
Load all the secrets from a file and set them.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret load ./secrets.env
```

The file needs to be in the _dotenv_ or bash format of key-value pairs.

```sh title="secrets.env"
KEY_1=VALUE1
KEY_2=VALUE2
```

Optionally, set the secrets in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret load ./prod.env --stage=production
```


</Segment>
<NestedTitle id="secret-remove" Tag="h4" parent="secret ">remove</NestedTitle>
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst secret remove <name>
```
</Section>
<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">name</code></p>
The name of the secret.
</Section>
Remove a secret.

For example, remove the `sst.Secret` called `StripeSecret`.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst secret remove StripeSecret
```

Optionally, remove a secret in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst secret remove StripeSecret --stage=production

Optionally, list the secrets in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst secret list --stage=production
```
</Segment>

### shell
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst shell [command]
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">command?</code></p>
A command to run.
</Section>
Run a command with **all the resources linked** to the environment. This is useful for running scripts against your infrastructure.

For example, let's say you have the following resources in your app.

```js title="sst.config.ts" {5,9}
new sst.aws.Bucket("MyMainBucket");
new sst.aws.Bucket("MyAdminBucket");
```

We can now write a script that'll can access both these resources with the [JS SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/).

```js title="my-script.js" "Resource.MyMainBucket.name" "Resource.MyAdminBucket.name"
import { Resource } from "sst";

console.log(Resource.MyMainBucket.name, Resource.MyAdminBucket.name);
```

And run the script with `sst shell`.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst shell node my-script.js
```

This'll have access to all the buckets from above.

:::tip
Run the command with `--` to pass arguments to it.
:::

To pass arguments into the script, you'll need to prefix it using `--`.

```bash frame="none" frame="none" /--(?!a)/
sst shell -- node my-script.js --arg1 --arg2
```

If no command is passed in, it opens a shell session with the linked resources.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst shell
```

This is useful if you want to run multiple commands, all while accessing the resources in your app.
</Segment>

### remove
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst remove
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Flags
- <p><code class="key">target</code> <code class="primitive">string</code></p>
Comma seperated list of target URNs.
</Section>
Removes your application. By default, it removes your personal stage.

:::tip
The resources in your app are removed based on the `removal` setting in your `sst.config.ts`.
:::

This does not remove the SST _state_ and _bootstrap_ resources in your account as these might still be in use by other apps. You can remove them manually if you want to reset your account, [learn more](docs/providers/#state).

Optionally, remove your app from a specific stage.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst remove --stage=production
```
</Segment>

### unlock
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst unlock
```
</Section>
When you run `sst deploy`, it acquires a lock on your state file to prevent concurrent deploys.

However, if something unexpectedly kills the `sst deploy` process, or if you manage to run `sst deploy` concurrently, the lock might not be released.

This should not usually happen, but it can prevent you from deploying. You can run `sst unlock` to release the lock.
</Segment>

### version
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst version
```
</Section>
Prints the current version of the CLI.
</Segment>

sst upgrade [version]
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">version?</code></p>
A version to upgrade to.
</Section>
Upgrade the CLI to the latest version. Or optionally, pass in a version to upgrade to.

```bash frame="none"
sst upgrade 0.10

<Section type="parameters">
#### Subcommands
- <p>[<code class="key">enable</code>](#telemetry-enable)</p>
- <p>[<code class="key">disable</code>](#telemetry-disable)</p>
</Section>
Manage telemetry settings.

SST collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage. We track:
- Version of SST in use
- Command invoked, `sst dev`, `sst deploy`, etc.
- General machine information, like the number of CPUs, OS, CI/CD environment, etc.

This is completely optional and can be disabled at any time.

Comma seperated list of target URNs.
</Section>
Compares your local state with the state of the resources in the cloud provider. Any changes that are found are adopted into your local state. It will:

1. Go through every single resource in your state.
2. Make a call to the cloud provider to check the resource.
   - If the configs are different, it'll **update the state** to reflect the change.
   - If the resource doesn't exist anymore, it'll **remove it from the state**.

:::note
The `sst refresh` does not make changes to the resources in the cloud provider.
:::

This is useful for cases where you want to ensure that your local state is in sync with your cloud provider. [Learn more about how state works](/docs/providers/#how-state-works).
