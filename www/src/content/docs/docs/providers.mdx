title: Providers
description: Providers allow you to interact with cloud services. 
---

A provider is what allows SST to interact with the APIs of various cloud services. These are packages that can be installed through your `sst.config.ts`.

SST is built on Pulumi/Terraform and **supports 150+ providers**. This includes the major clouds like AWS, Azure, and GCP; but also services like Cloudflare, Stripe, Vercel, Auth0, etc.

Check out the full list in the [Directory](#directory).

---

## Install

To add a provider to your app run.

```bash
sst add <provider>
```

This command adds the provider to your config, installs the packages, and adds the namespace of the provider to your globals.

:::caution
Do not `import` the provider packages in your `sst.config.ts`.
:::

SST manages these packages internally and you do not need to import the package in your `sst.config.ts`.

:::tip
Your app can have multiple providers.
:::

The name of a provider comes from the **name of the package** in the [Directory](#directory). For example, `sst add planetscale`, will add the following to your `sst.config.ts`.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  providers: {
    planetscale: true
  }
}
```

You can add multiple providers to your app.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  providers: {
    aws: true,
    cloudflare: true
  }
}
```

Read more about the [`sst add`](/docs/reference/cli/#add) command.

---

## Configure

You can configure a provider in your `sst.config.ts`. For example, to change the region for AWS.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  providers: {
    aws: {
      region: "us-west-2"
    }
  }
}
```

You can check out the available list of options that you can configure for a provider over on the provider's docs. For example, here are the ones for [AWS](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/aws/api-docs/provider/#inputs) and [Cloudflare](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/cloudflare/api-docs/provider/#inputs).

---

### Versions

In addition to these options, you can also pass in the version of the provider you want to use. By default, SST uses the latest version.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  providers: {
    aws: {
      version: "6.27.0"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Credentials

Most providers will read your credentials from the environment. For example, for Cloudflare you might set your token like so.

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=aaaaaaaa_aaaaaaaaaaaa_aaaaaaaa
```

However, some providers also allow you to pass in the credentials through the config.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  providers: {
    cloudflare: {
      apiToken: "aaaaaaaa_aaaaaaaaaaaa_aaaaaaaa"
    }
  }
}
```

Read more about [configuring providers](/docs/reference/config/#providers).

---

## Components

The provider packages come with components that you can use in your app. 

For example, running `sst add aws` will allow you to use all the components under the `aws` namepsace.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
new aws.s3.BucketV2("b", {
  bucket: "mybucket",
  tags: {
    Name: "My bucket"
  }
});
```

Aside from components in the providers, SST also has a list of built-in components. These are typically higher level components that make it easy to add features to your app.

You can check these out in the sidebar. Read more about [Components](/docs/components/).

---

## Functions

Aside from the components, there are a collection of functions that are exposed by a provider. These are listed in the Pulumi docs as `getXXXXXX` on the sidebar.

For example, to get the AWS account being used in your app.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const current = await aws.getCallerIdentity({});

const accountId = current.accountId;
const callerArn = current.arn;
const callerUser = current.userId;
```

Or to get the current region.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const current = await aws.getRegion({});

const region = current.name;
```


---

#### Output versions

The above are _async_ methods that return promises. That means that if you call these in your app, they'll block the deployment of any resources that are defined after it.

:::tip
Outputs don't block your deployments.
:::

So we instead recommend using the _Output_ version of these functions. For example, if we wanted to set the above as environment variables in a function, we would do something like this

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction, {
  handler: "src/lambda.handler",
  environment: {
    ACCOUNT: aws.getCallerIdentityOutput({}).accountId,
    REGION: aws.getRegionOutput().name
  }
}
```

The `aws.getXXXXOutput` functions typically return an object of type _`Output<primitive>`_. Read more about [Outputs](/docs/components/#outputs).

---

## Instances

You can create multiple instances of a provider that's in your config. By default SST creates one instance of each provider in your `sst.config.ts` with the defaults. By you can create multiple instances in your app.  

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const useast1 = new aws.Provider("AnotherAWS");
```

This is useful for multi-region or multi-account deployments.

---

### Multi-region

You might want to create multiple providers in cases where some resources in your app need to go to one region, while others need to go to a separate region.

Let's look at an example. Assume your app is normally deployed to `us-west-1`. But you need to create an ACM certificate that needs to be deployed to `us-east-1`.

```ts {1} title="sst.config.ts" "{ provider: useast1 }"
const useast1 = new aws.Provider("useast1", { region: "us-east-1" });

new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction, "src/lambda.handler");

new aws.acm.Certificate("cert", {
  domainName: "foo.com",
  validationMethod: "EMAIL",
}, { provider: useast1 });
```

Here the function is created in your default region, `us-west-1`. While the certificate is created in `us-east-1`.
