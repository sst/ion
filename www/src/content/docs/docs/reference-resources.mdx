title: Reference Resources
description: Reference externally created resources in your app.
---

Referencing is the process of _using_ some externally created resources in your SST app. But without having SST to manage them.

This is for when you have some resources that are either managed by a different team or a different IaC tool. Typically these are low-level resources and not SST's built-in components.

---

## How it works

When you create a resource in your SST app, two things happen. First, the resource is created by making a bunch of calls to your cloud provider. Second, SST makes a call to _get_ the resource from the cloud provider. The data that it gets back is stored in your [state](/docs/state/).

:::note
When you reference a resource or create it, you get the same type of object.
:::

When you reference a resource, it skips the creation step and just gets the resource. It does this every time you deploy. But the object you get in both cases is the same.

---

## How to reference

You reference a resource by passing in a property of the resource. These properties are the same ones that you'd use if you were trying to import them.

:::tip
You can look up a resource with its [Import Property](/docs/import-resources/#import-properties).
:::

We've compiled a list of the most commonly referenced low-level resources and their [Import Properties](/docs/import-resources/#import-properties).

Most low-level resources come with a `static get` method that use this property to look up the resource.

#### Look up the resource

Say you want to reference a previously created S3 Bucket with the following name.

```txt
mybucket-xnbmhcvd
```

We are going use the [`static aws.s3.BucketV2.get`](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/aws/api-docs/s3/bucketv2/#look-up) method.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const bucket = aws.s3.BucketV2.get("MyBucket", "mybucket-xnbmhcvd");
```

This gives you the same bucket object that you'd get if you had created this resource in your app. Let's take it a step further.

---

#### Make it linkable

You can use the [`sst.Linkable`](/docs/component/linkable/) component, to can link any property of this resource.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
const storage = new sst.Linkable("MyStorage", {
  properties: {
    domain: bucket.bucketDomainName
  }
});
```

Here we are using the domain name of the bucket as an example.

---

#### Link to it

And link it to a function.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {9}
new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  handler: "src/lambda.handler",
  link: [storage]
});
```

Now you can use the [SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/) to access them at runtime.

```js title="src/lambda.ts"
import { Resource } from "sst";

console.log(Resource.MyStorage.domain);
```
