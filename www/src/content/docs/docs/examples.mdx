## API Gateway auth

Enable IAM and JWT authorizers for API Gateway routes.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const api = new sst.aws.ApiGatewayV2("MyApi", {
  domain: {
    domainName: "api.ion.sst.sh",
    path: "v1",
  },
});
api.route("GET /", {
  handler: "route.handler",
});
api.route("GET /foo", "route.handler", { auth: { iam: true } });
api.route("GET /bar", "route.handler", {
  auth: {
    jwt: {
      issuer:
        "https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_Rq4d8zILG",
      audiences: ["user@example.com"],
    },

## AWS monorepo

A full-stack TypeScript monorepo template that deploys a frontend, a database, and an API
to AWS.

While, [drop-in mode](/docs/#drop-in-mode) is great for simple projects, we recommend using
this template for projects that are going to have multiple packages. 

#### Project structure

The app is split into the separate `packages/` and an `infra/` directory.

```txt {2}
my-sst-app
├─ sst.config.ts
├─ package.json
├─ packages
│  ├─ functions
│  ├─ frontend
│  ├─ scripts
│  └─ core
└─ infra
```

The `packages/` directory includes the following:

- `core/`

  This directory includes shared code that can be used by other packages. These are
  defined as modules. For example, we have an `Example` module.

  ```ts title="packages/core/src/example/index.ts"
  export module Example {
    export function hello() {
      return "Hello, world!";
    }
  }
  ```

  We exports this using the following in the `package.json`:

  ```json title="packages/core/package.json"
  "exports": {
    "./*": [
      "./src/*/index.ts",
      "./src/*.ts"
    ]
  }
  ```

  This will allow us to import the `Example` module by doing:

  ```ts
  import { Example } from "@aws-monorepo/core/example";

  Example.hello();
  ```

- `functions/`

  This directory includes our Lambda funcitons. It imports from the `core/`
  package by using it as a local dependency.

- `frontend/`

  This directory includes a simple Vite app. It references environment variables
  from our app and is started locally using.

  ```json title="packages/frontend/package.json"
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "sst dev vite dev"
  }
  ```

- `scripts/`

  This directory includes scripts that you can run on your SST app using the `sst shell` CLI
  and [`tsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx). For example, to the run the example
  `scripts/src/example.ts`, run the following from `packages/scripts/`.

  ```bash
  npm run shell src/example.ts
  ```
  
 #### Infrastructure

 The `infra/` directory allows you to logically split the infrastructure of your app into
 separate files. This can be helpful as your app grows.

 In the template, we have an `api.ts`, `database.ts`, and `frontend.ts`. These export
 resources that can be used in the other infrastructure files.

 They are also re-exported in the `infra/index.ts` file.

 ```ts title="infra/index.ts"
 export * from "./api";
 export * from "./database";
 export * from "./frontend";
 ```

 And to use them in your `sst.config.ts` we do an dynamic import. This ensures that the
 infrastructure is only created in the `run` function.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const infra = await import("./infra");

return {
  api: infra.api.url,
};
```

## Subscribe to queues

Create an SQS queue, subscribe to it, and publish to it from a function.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const queue = new sst.aws.Queue("MyQueue");
queue.subscribe("subscriber.handler");

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "publisher.handler",
  link: [queue],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
  queue: queue.url,
};
```

---
## Router and function URL

Creates a router that routes all requests to a function with a URL.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyApi", {
  handler: "api.handler",
  url: true,
});
const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
  routes: {
    "/*": api.url,
  },
});
return {
  router: router.url,
};
```

View the [full example](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-router).


---
## Simple static site

Deploy a simple HTML file as a static site with S3 and CloudFront.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
// Deploys the current directory as a static site
new sst.aws.StaticSite("MySite");
```

View the [full example](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-static-site).


---
## Swift on Lambda

Deploys a simple Swift applicaiton to Lambda using the `al2023` runtime.

:::note
Building this function requires Docker.
:::

Check out the README in the repo for more details.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const swift = new sst.aws.Function("Swift", {
  runtime: "provided.al2023",
  architecture: process.arch === "arm64" ? "arm64" : "x86_64",
  bundle: build("app"),
  handler: "bootstrap",
  url: true,
});
const router = new sst.aws.Router("SwiftRouter", {
  routes: {
    "/*": swift.url,
  },
  domain: "swift.dev.sst.dev",
});
return {
  url: router.url,
};
```

## Subscribe to topics

Create an SNS topic, publish to it from a function, and subscribe to it with a function and a queue.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const queue = new sst.aws.Queue("MyQueue");
queue.subscribe("subscriber.handler");

const topic = new sst.aws.SnsTopic("MyTopic");
topic.subscribe("subscriber.handler", {});
topic.subscribeQueue(queue.arn);

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "publisher.handler",
  link: [topic],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
  topic: topic.name,
};
```

---
## Vector search

Store and search for vector data using the Vector component. Includes a seeder API that
uses an LLM to generate embeddings for some movies and optionally their posters.

Once seeded, you can call the search API to query the vector database.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const vector = new sst.aws.Vector("MyVectorDB", {
  model: "text-embedding-ada-002",
  //model: "amazon.titan-embed-image-v1",
  openAiApiKey: new sst.Secret("OpenAiApiKey").value,
});

const seeder = new sst.aws.Function("Seeder", {
  handler: "index.seeder",
  link: [vector],
  copyFiles: [
    { from: "iron-man.jpg", to: "iron-man.jpg" },
    {
      from: "black-widow.jpg",
      to: "black-widow.jpg",
    },
    {
      from: "spider-man.jpg",
      to: "spider-man.jpg",
    },
    { from: "thor.jpg", to: "thor.jpg" },
    {
      from: "captain-america.jpg",
      to: "captain-america.jpg",
    },
  ],
  url: true,
});

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "index.app",
  link: [vector],
  url: true,
});

return { seeder: seeder.url, app: app.url };
```

## React SPA with Vite

Deploy a React single-page app (SPA) with Vite to S3 and CloudFront.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
new sst.aws.StaticSite("Web", {
  build: {
    command: "pnpm run build",
    output: "dist",
  },
});
```

---
## Default function props

Set default props for all the functions in your app using the global [`$transform`](/docs/reference/global/#transform).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
$transform(sst.aws.Function, (args) => {
  args.runtime = "nodejs14.x";
  args.environment = {
    FOO: "BAR",
  };
});
new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  handler: "index.ts",
});
```
