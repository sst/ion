});

return {
  app: app.url,
  table: table.name,
};
```

## FFmpeg in Lambda

Uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to process videos. In this example, it takes a `clip.mp4`
and grabs a single frame from it.

:::tip
You don't need to use a Lambda layer to use FFmpeg.
:::

We use the [`ffmpeg-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-static) package that
contains pre-built binaries for all architectures.

```ts title="index.ts"
import ffmpeg from "ffmpeg-static";
```

We can use this to spawn a child process and run FFmpeg.

```ts title="index.ts"
spawnSync(ffmpeg, ffmpegParams, { stdio: "pipe" });
```

We don't need a layer when we deploy this because SST will use the right binary for the
target Lambda architecture; including `arm64`.

```json title="sst.config.ts"
{
  nodejs: { install: ["ffmpeg-static"] }
}
```

All this is handled by [`nodejs.install`](/docs/component/aws/function#nodejs-install).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const func = new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  url: true,
  memory: "2 GB",
  timeout: "15 minutes",
  handler: "index.handler",
  copyFiles: [{ from: "clip.mp4" }],
  nodejs: { install: ["ffmpeg-static"] },
});

return {
  url: func.url,
};
```

---
## IAM permissions boundaries

Use permissions boundaries to set the maximum permissions for all IAM roles that'll be
created in your app.

In this example, the Function has the `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` and `sqs:ListQueues`
permissions. However, we create a permissions boundary that only allows `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`.
And we apply it to all Roles in the app using the global
[`$transform`](/docs/reference/global/#transform).

As a result, the Function is only allowed to list S3 buckets. If you open the deployed URL,
you'll see that the SQS list call fails.

Learn more about [AWS IAM permissions boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
// Create a permission boundary
const permissionsBoundary = new aws.iam.Policy("MyPermissionsBoundary", {
  policy: aws.iam.getPolicyDocumentOutput({
    statements: [
      {
        actions: ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets"],
        resources: ["*"],
      },
    ],
  }).json,
});

// Apply the boundary to all roles
$transform(aws.iam.Role, (args) => {
  args.permissionsBoundary = permissionsBoundary;
});

// The boundary automatically applies to this Function's role
const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "index.handler",
  permissions: [
    {
      actions: ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets", "sqs:ListQueues"],
      resources: ["*"],
    },
  ],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
};
```

## Current AWS account

You can use the `aws.getXXXXOutput()` provider functions to get info about the current
AWS account.
Learn more about [provider functions](/docs/providers/#functions).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
return {
  region: aws.getRegionOutput().name,
  account: aws.getCallerIdentityOutput({}).accountId,
};
```

---
## Kinesis streams

Create a Kinesis stream, and subscribe to it with a function.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const stream = new sst.aws.KinesisStream("MyStream");

// Create a function subscribing to all events
stream.subscribe("subscriber.all");

// Create a function subscribing to events of `bar` type
stream.subscribe("subscriber.filtered", {
  filters: [
    {
      data: {
        type: ["bar"],
      },
    },
  ],
});

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "publisher.handler",
  link: [stream],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
  stream: stream.name,
};
```

## Puppeteer in Lambda

To use Puppeteer in a Lambda function you need:

1. [`puppeteer-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core)
2. Chromium
   - In `sst dev`, we'll use a locally installed Chromium version.
   - In `sst deploy`, we'll use the [`@sparticuz/chromium`](https://github.com/sparticuz/chromium) package. It comes with a pre-built binary for Lambda.

#### Chromium version

Since Puppeteer has a preferred version of Chromium, we'll need to check the version of
Chrome that a given version of Puppeteer supports. Head over to the
[Puppeteer's Chromium Support page](https://pptr.dev/chromium-support) and check which
versions work together.

For example, Puppeteer v23.1.1 supports Chrome for Testing 127.0.6533.119. So, we'll use the
v127 of `@sparticuz/chromium`.

```bash
npm install puppeteer-core@23.1.1 @sparticuz/chromium@127.0.0
```

#### Install Chromium locally

To use this locally, you'll need to install Chromium.

```bash
npx @puppeteer/browsers install chromium@latest --path /tmp/localChromium
```

Once installed you'll see the location of the Chromium binary, `/tmp/localChromium/chromium/mac_arm-1350406/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium`.

Update this in your Lambda function.

```ts title="index.ts"
// This is the path to the local Chromium binary
const YOUR_LOCAL_CHROMIUM_PATH = "/tmp/localChromium/chromium/mac_arm-1350406/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium";
```

You'll notice we are using the right binary with the `SST_DEV` environment variable.

```ts title="index.ts" {4-6}
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: chromium.args,
  defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
  executablePath: process.env.SST_DEV
    ? YOUR_LOCAL_CHROMIUM_PATH
    : await chromium.executablePath(),
  headless: chromium.headless,
});
```

#### Deploy

We don't need a layer to deploy this because `@sparticuz/chromium` comes with a pre-built
binary for Lambda.

:::note
As of writing this, `arm64` is not supported by `@sparticuz/chromium`.
:::

We just need to set it in the [`nodejs.install`](/docs/component/aws/function#nodejs-install).

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  nodejs: {
    install: ["@sparticuz/chromium"]
  }
}
```

And on deploy, SST will use the right binary.

:::tip
You don't need to use a Lambda layer to use Puppeteer.
:::

We are giving our function more memory and a longer timeout since running Puppeteer can
take a while.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  url: true,
  memory: "2 GB",
  timeout: "15 minutes",
  handler: "index.handler",
  nodejs: {
    install: ["@sparticuz/chromium"],
  },
});

return {
  url: api.url,
};
```

---
## Subscribe to queues

Create an SQS queue, subscribe to it, and publish to it from a function.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const queue = new sst.aws.Queue("MyQueue");
queue.subscribe("subscriber.handler");

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "publisher.handler",
  link: [queue],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
  queue: queue.url,
};
```

View the [full example](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-queue).


---
## Router and function URL

Creates a router that routes all requests to a function with a URL.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyApi", {
  handler: "api.handler",
  url: true,
});
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket", {
  public: true,
});
const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
  domain: "router.ion.dev.sst.dev",
  routes: {
    "/api/*": api.url,
    "/*": $interpolate`https://${bucket.domain}`,
  },
});

return {
  router: router.url,
  bucket: bucket.domain,
};
```

---
## Sharp in Lambda

Uses the [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) library to resize images. In this example,
it resizes a `logo.png` local file to 100x100 pixels.

```json title="sst.config.ts"
{
  nodejs: { install: ["sharp"] }
}
```

We don't need a layer to deploy this because `sharp` comes with a pre-built binary for Lambda.
This is handled by [`nodejs.install`](/docs/component/aws/function#nodejs-install).

:::tip
You don't need to use a Lambda layer to use Sharp.
:::

In dev, this uses the sharp npm package locally.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "sharp": "^0.33.5"
  }
}
```

On deploy, SST will use the right binary from the sharp package for the target Lambda
architecture.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const func = new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  url: true,
  handler: "index.handler",
  nodejs: { install: ["sharp"] },
  copyFiles: [{ from: "logo.png" }],
});

return {
  url: func.url,
};
```

## Subscribe to topics

Create an SNS topic, publish to it from a function, and subscribe to it with a function and a queue.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const queue = new sst.aws.Queue("MyQueue");
queue.subscribe("subscriber.handler");

const topic = new sst.aws.SnsTopic("MyTopic");
topic.subscribe("subscriber.handler", {});
topic.subscribeQueue(queue.arn);

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "publisher.handler",
  link: [topic],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
  topic: topic.name,
};
```

---
## Vector search

Store and search for vector data using the Vector component. Includes a seeder API that
uses an LLM to generate embeddings for some movies and optionally their posters.

Once seeded, you can call the search API to query the vector database.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const OpenAiApiKey = new sst.Secret("OpenAiApiKey");
const vector = new sst.aws.Vector("MyVectorDB", {
  dimension: 1536,
});

const seeder = new sst.aws.Function("Seeder", {
  handler: "index.seeder",
  link: [OpenAiApiKey, vector],
  copyFiles: [
    { from: "iron-man.jpg", to: "iron-man.jpg" },
    {
      from: "black-widow.jpg",
      to: "black-widow.jpg",
    },
    {
      from: "spider-man.jpg",
      to: "spider-man.jpg",
    },
    { from: "thor.jpg", to: "thor.jpg" },
    {
      from: "captain-america.jpg",
      to: "captain-america.jpg",
    },
  ],
  url: true,
});

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "index.app",
  link: [OpenAiApiKey, vector],
  url: true,
});

return { seeder: seeder.url, app: app.url };
```

## Cloudflare KV

This example creates a Cloudflare KV namespace and links it to a worker. Now you can use the
SDK to interact with the KV namespace in your worker.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const storage = new sst.cloudflare.Kv("MyStorage");
const worker = new sst.cloudflare.Worker("Worker", {
  url: true,
  link: [storage],
  handler: "index.ts",
});

return {
  url: worker.url,
};
```

---
## Link multiple secrets

You might have multiple secrets that need to be used across your app. It can be tedious to
create a new secret and link it to each function or resource.

A common pattern to addresses this is to create an object with all your secrets and then
link them all at once. Now when you have a new secret, you can add it to the object and
it will be automatically available to all your resources.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
// Manage all secrets together
const secrets = {
  secret1: new sst.Secret("Secret1", "some-secret-value-1"),
  secret2: new sst.Secret("Secret2", "some-secret-value-2"),
};
const allSecrets = Object.values(secrets);

const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");

const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyApi", {
  link: [bucket, ...allSecrets],
  handler: "index.handler",
  url: true,
});

return {
  url: api.url,
};
```

---
## Default function props

Set default props for all the functions in your app using the global [`$transform`](/docs/reference/global/#transform).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
$transform(sst.aws.Function, (args) => {
  args.runtime = "nodejs14.x";
  args.environment = {
    FOO: "BAR",
  };
});
new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  handler: "index.ts",
});
```

---
## Vercel domains

Creates a router that uses domains purchased through and hosted in your Vercel account.
Ensure the `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_TEAM_ID` environment variables are set.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
  domain: {
    name: "ion.sst.moe",
    dns: sst.vercel.dns({ domain: "sst.moe" }),
  },
  routes: {
    "/*": "https://sst.dev",
  },
});
return {
  router: router.url,
};
```
