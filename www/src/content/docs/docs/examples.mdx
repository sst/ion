};
```

---
## FFmpeg in Lambda

Uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to process videos. In this example, it takes a `clip.mp4`
and grabs a single frame from it.

:::tip
You don't need to use a Lambda layer to use FFmpeg.
:::

We use the [`ffmpeg-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-static) package that
contains pre-built binaries for all architectures.

```ts title="index.ts"
import ffmpeg from "ffmpeg-static";
```

We can use this to spawn a child process and run FFmpeg.

```ts title="index.ts"
spawnSync(ffmpeg, ffmpegParams, { stdio: "pipe" });
```

We don't need a layer when we deploy this because SST will use the right binary for the
target Lambda architecture; including `arm64`.

```json title="sst.config.ts"
{
  nodejs: { install: ["ffmpeg-static"] }
}
```

All this is handled by [`nodejs.install`](/docs/component/aws/function#nodejs-install).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const func = new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  url: true,
  memory: "2 GB",
  timeout: "15 minutes",
  handler: "index.handler",
  copyFiles: [{ from: "clip.mp4" }],
  nodejs: { install: ["ffmpeg-static"] },
});

return {
  url: func.url,
};
```

## AWS Hono streaming

An example on how to enable streaming for Lambda functions using Hono.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  streaming: true
}
```

While `sst dev` doesn't support streaming, we can conditionally enable it on deploy.

```ts title="index.ts"
export const handler = process.env.SST_LIVE ? handle(app) : streamHandle(app);
```

This will return the standard handler for `sst dev`.

:::note
Streaming is currently not supported in `sst dev`.
:::

To test this in your terminal, use the `curl` command with the `--no-buffer` option.

```bash "--no-buffer"
curl --no-buffer https://u3dyblk457ghskwbmzrbylpxoi0ayrbb.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws
```

Here we are using a Function URL directly because API Gateway doesn't support streaming.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const hono = new sst.aws.Function("Hono", {
  url: true,
  streaming: true,
  timeout: "15 minutes",
  handler: "index.handler",
});
return {
  api: hono.url,
};
```

---
## IAM permissions boundaries

Use permissions boundaries to set the maximum permissions for all IAM roles that'll be
created in your app.

In this example, the Function has the `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` and `sqs:ListQueues`
permissions. However, we create a permissions boundary that only allows `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`.
And we apply it to all Roles in the app using the global
[`$transform`](/docs/reference/global/#transform).

As a result, the Function is only allowed to list S3 buckets. If you open the deployed URL,
you'll see that the SQS list call fails.

Learn more about [AWS IAM permissions boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
// Create a permission boundary
const permissionsBoundary = new aws.iam.Policy("MyPermissionsBoundary", {
  policy: aws.iam.getPolicyDocumentOutput({
    statements: [
      {
        actions: ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets"],
        resources: ["*"],
      },
    ],
  }).json,
});

// Apply the boundary to all roles
$transform(aws.iam.Role, (args) => {
  args.permissionsBoundary = permissionsBoundary;
});

// The boundary automatically applies to this Function's role
const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "index.handler",
  permissions: [
    {
      actions: ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets", "sqs:ListQueues"],
      resources: ["*"],
    },
  ],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
};
```

---
## Current AWS account

You can use the `aws.getXXXXOutput()` provider functions to get info about the current
AWS account.
Learn more about [provider functions](/docs/providers/#functions).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
return {
  region: aws.getRegionOutput().name,
  account: aws.getCallerIdentityOutput({}).accountId,
};
```

View the [full example](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-info).


---
## AWS JSX Email

Uses [JSX Email](https://jsx.email) and the `Email` component to design and send emails.

To test this example, change the `sst.config.ts` to use your own email address.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
sender: "email@example.com"
```

Then run.

```bash
npm install
npx sst dev
```

You'll get an email from AWS asking you to confirm your email address. Click the link to
verify it.

Next, go to the URL in the `sst dev` CLI output. You should now receive an email rendered
using JSX Email.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { Template } from "./templates/email";

await render(Template({
  email: "spongebob@example.com",
  name: "Spongebob Squarepants"
}))
```

Once you are ready to go to production, you can:

- [Request production access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html) for SES
- And [use your domain](/docs/component/aws/email/) to send emails
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const email = new sst.aws.Email("MyEmail", {
  sender: "email@example.com",
});
const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyApi", {
  handler: "index.handler",
  link: [email],
  url: true,
});

return {
  api: api.url,
};
```

---
## Kinesis streams

Create a Kinesis stream, and subscribe to it with a function.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const stream = new sst.aws.KinesisStream("MyStream");

// Create a function subscribing to all events
stream.subscribe("subscriber.all");

// Create a function subscribing to events of `bar` type
stream.subscribe("subscriber.filtered", {
  filters: [
    {
      data: {
        type: ["bar"],
      },
    },
  ],
});

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "publisher.handler",
  link: [stream],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
  stream: stream.name,
};
```

View the [full example](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-kinesis-stream).


---
## AWS Lambda streaming

An example on how to enable streaming for Lambda functions.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  streaming: true
}
```

While `sst dev` doesn't support streaming, you can use the
[`lambda-stream`](https://github.com/astuyve/lambda-stream) package to test locally.

```bash
npm install lambda-stream
```

Then, you can use the `streamifyResponse` function to wrap your handler:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { APIGatewayProxyEventV2 } from "aws-lambda";
import { streamifyResponse, ResponseStream } from "lambda-stream";

export const handler = streamifyResponse(myHandler);

async function myHandler(
  _event: APIGatewayProxyEventV2,
  responseStream: ResponseStream
): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise((resolve, _reject) => {
    responseStream.setContentType('text/plain')
    responseStream.write('Hello')
    setTimeout(() => {
      responseStream.write(' World')
      responseStream.end()
      resolve()
    }, 3000)
  })
}
```

When deployed, this will use the `awslambda.streamifyResponse`.

:::note
Streaming is currently not supported in `sst dev`.
:::

To test this in your terminal, use the `curl` command with the `--no-buffer` option.

```bash "--no-buffer"
curl --no-buffer https://u3dyblk457ghskwbmzrbylpxoi0ayrbb.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws
```

Here we are using a Function URL directly because API Gateway doesn't support streaming.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const fn = new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  url: true,
  streaming: true,
  timeout: "15 minutes",
  handler: "index.handler",
});

return {
  url: fn.url,
};
```

---
## AWS multi-region

To deploy resources to multiple AWS regions, you can create a new provider for the region
you want to deploy to.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const provider = new aws.Provider("MyProvider", { region: "us-west-2" });
```

And then pass that in to the resource.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", { handler: "index.handler" }, { provider });
```

If no provider is passed in, the default provider will be used. And if no region is
specified, the default region from your credentials will be used.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const east = new sst.aws.Function("MyEastFunction", {
  url: true,
  handler: "index.handler",
});

const provider = new aws.Provider("MyWestProvider", { region: "us-west-2" });
const west = new sst.aws.Function(
  "MyWestFunction",
  {
    url: true,
    handler: "index.handler",
  },
  { provider }
);

return {
  east: east.url,
  west: west.url,
};
```

## AWS Next.js basic auth

Deploys a simple Next.js app and adds basic auth to it.

This is useful for dev environments where you want to share your app your team but ensure
that it's not publicly accessible.

:::tip
You can use this for all the SSR sites, like Astro, Remix, SvelteKit, etc.
:::

This works by injecting some code into a CloudFront function that checks the basic auth
header and matches it against the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` secrets.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  injection: $interpolate`
    if (
        !event.request.headers.authorization
          || event.request.headers.authorization.value !== "Basic ${basicAuth}"
       ) {
      return {
        statusCode: 401,
        headers: {
          "www-authenticate": { value: "Basic" }
        }
      };
    }`,
}
```

To deploy this, you need to first set the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` secrets.

```bash
sst secret set USERNAME my-username
sst secret set PASSWORD my-password
```

If you are deploying this to preview environments, you might want to set the secrets using
the [`--fallback`](/docs/reference/cli#secret) flag.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const username = new sst.Secret("USERNAME");
const password = new sst.Secret("PASSWORD");
const basicAuth = $resolve([username.value, password.value]).apply(
  ([username, password]) =>
    Buffer.from(`${username}:${password}`).toString("base64")
);

new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", {
  server: {
    // Don't password protect prod
    edge: $app.stage !== "production"
      ? {
        viewerRequest: {
          injection: $interpolate`
            if (
                !event.request.headers.authorization
                  || event.request.headers.authorization.value !== "Basic ${basicAuth}"
               ) {
              return {
                statusCode: 401,
                headers: {
                  "www-authenticate": { value: "Basic" }
                }
              };
            }`,
        },
      }
      : undefined,
  },
});
```

## AWS Next.js streaming

An example of how to use streaming Next.js RSC. Uses `Suspense` to stream an async component.

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <Friends />
</Suspense>
```

For this demo we also need to make sure the route is not statically built.

```ts title="app/page.tsx"
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
```

This is deployed with OpenNext, which needs a config to enable streaming.

```ts title="open-next.config.ts" {4}
export default {
  default: {
    override: {
      wrapper: "aws-lambda-streaming"
    }
  }
};
```

You should see the _friends_ section load after a 3 second delay.

:::note
Safari handles streaming differently than other browsers.
:::

Safari uses a [different heuristic](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=252413) to
determine when to stream data. You need to render _enough_ initial HTML to trigger streaming.
This is typically only a problem for demo apps.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb");
```

View the [full example](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-nextjs-stream).

## Prisma in Lambda

To use Prisma in a Lambda function you need to

- Generate the Prisma Client with the right architecture
- Copy the generated client to the function
- Run the function inside a VPC

You can set the architecture using the `binaryTargets` option in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma"
// For x86
binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"]
// For ARM
// binaryTargets = ["native", "linux-arm64-openssl-3.0.x"]
```

You can also switch to ARM, just make sure to also change the function architecture in your
`sst.config.ts`.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  // For ARM
  architecture: "arm64"
}
```

To generate the client, you need to run `prisma generate` when you make changes to the
schema.

Since this [needs to be done on every deploy](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/help-and-troubleshooting/help-articles/vercel-caching-issue#a-custom-postinstall-script), we add a `postinstall` script to the `package.json`.

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "prisma generate"
}
```

This runs the command on `npm install`.

We then need to copy the generated client to the function when we deploy.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  copyFiles: [{ from: "node_modules/.prisma/client/" }]
}
```

Our function also needs to run inside a VPC, since Prisma doesn't support the Data API.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  vpc
}
```

#### Prisma in serverless environments

Prisma is [not great in serverless environments](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections#serverless-environments-faas). For a couple of reasons:

1. It doesn't support Data API, so you need to manage the connection pool on your own.
2. Without the Data API, your functions need to run inside a VPC.
   - You cannot use `sst dev` without [connecting to the VPC](/docs/live#using-a-vpc).
3. Due to the internal architecture of their client, it's also has slower cold starts.

Instead we recommend using [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team). This example is here for
reference for people that are already using Prisma.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc", { nat: "managed" });
const rds = new sst.aws.Postgres("MyPostgres", { vpc });

const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyApi", {
  vpc,
  url: true,
  link: [rds],
  // For ARM
  // architecture: "arm64",
  handler: "index.handler",
  copyFiles: [{ from: "node_modules/.prisma/client/" }],
});

return {
  api: api.url,
};
```

## Puppeteer in Lambda

To use Puppeteer in a Lambda function you need:

1. [`puppeteer-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core)
2. Chromium
   - In `sst dev`, we'll use a locally installed Chromium version.
   - In `sst deploy`, we'll use the [`@sparticuz/chromium`](https://github.com/sparticuz/chromium) package. It comes with a pre-built binary for Lambda.

#### Chromium version

Since Puppeteer has a preferred version of Chromium, we'll need to check the version of
Chrome that a given version of Puppeteer supports. Head over to the
[Puppeteer's Chromium Support page](https://pptr.dev/chromium-support) and check which
versions work together.

For example, Puppeteer v23.1.1 supports Chrome for Testing 127.0.6533.119. So, we'll use the
v127 of `@sparticuz/chromium`.

```bash
npm install puppeteer-core@23.1.1 @sparticuz/chromium@127.0.0
```

#### Install Chromium locally

To use this locally, you'll need to install Chromium.

```bash
npx @puppeteer/browsers install chromium@latest --path /tmp/localChromium
```

Once installed you'll see the location of the Chromium binary, `/tmp/localChromium/chromium/mac_arm-1350406/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium`.

Update this in your Lambda function.

```ts title="index.ts"
// This is the path to the local Chromium binary
const YOUR_LOCAL_CHROMIUM_PATH = "/tmp/localChromium/chromium/mac_arm-1350406/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium";
```

You'll notice we are using the right binary with the `SST_DEV` environment variable.

```ts title="index.ts" {4-6}
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: chromium.args,
  defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
  executablePath: process.env.SST_DEV
    ? YOUR_LOCAL_CHROMIUM_PATH
    : await chromium.executablePath(),
  headless: chromium.headless,
});
```

#### Deploy

We don't need a layer to deploy this because `@sparticuz/chromium` comes with a pre-built
binary for Lambda.

:::note
As of writing this, `arm64` is not supported by `@sparticuz/chromium`.
:::

We just need to set it in the [`nodejs.install`](/docs/component/aws/function#nodejs-install).

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  nodejs: {
    install: ["@sparticuz/chromium"]
  }
}
```

And on deploy, SST will use the right binary.

:::tip
You don't need to use a Lambda layer to use Puppeteer.
:::

We are giving our function more memory and a longer timeout since running Puppeteer can
take a while.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  url: true,
  memory: "2 GB",
  timeout: "15 minutes",
  handler: "index.handler",
  nodejs: {
    install: ["@sparticuz/chromium"],
  },
});

return {
  url: api.url,
};
```

## Subscribe to queues

Create an SQS queue, subscribe to it, and publish to it from a function.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const queue = new sst.aws.Queue("MyQueue");
queue.subscribe("subscriber.handler");

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "publisher.handler",
  link: [queue],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
  queue: queue.url,
};

## AWS Remix streaming

Follows the [Remix Streaming](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/streaming) guide to create
an app that streams data.

Uses the `defer` utility to stream data through the `loader` function.

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
return defer({
  spongebob,
  friends: friendsPromise,
});
```

Then uses the the `Suspense` and `Await` components to render the data.

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <Await resolve={friends}>
    { /* ... */ }
  </Await>
</Suspense>
```

You should see the _friends_ section load after a 3 second delay.

:::note
Safari handles streaming differently than other browsers.
:::

Safari uses a [different heuristic](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=252413) to
determine when to stream data. You need to render _enough_ initial HTML to trigger streaming.
This is typically only a problem for demo apps.

Streaming works out of the box with the `Remix` component.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
new sst.aws.Remix("MyWeb");
```

## Router and bucket

Creates a router that serves static files from the `public` folder of a given bucket.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
// Create a bucket that CloudFront can access
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket", {
  access: "cloudfront",
});

// Upload the image to the `public` folder
new aws.s3.BucketObjectv2("MyImage", {
  bucket: bucket.name,
  key: "public/spongebob.svg",
  contentType: "image/svg+xml",
  source: $asset("spongebob.svg"),
});

const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
  routes: {
    "/*": {
      bucket,
      rewrite: { regex: "^/(.*)$", to: "/public/$1" },
    },
  },
});

return {
  image: $interpolate`${router.url}/spongebob.svg`,
};
```

---
## Router and function URL

Creates a router that routes all requests to a function with a URL.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyApi", {
  handler: "api.handler",
  url: true,
});
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket", {
  access: "public",
});
const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
  domain: "router.ion.dev.sst.dev",
  routes: {
    "/api/*": api.url,
    "/*": $interpolate`https://${bucket.domain}`,
  },
});

return {
  router: router.url,
  bucket: bucket.domain,
};
```

## Sharp in Lambda

Uses the [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) library to resize images. In this example,
it resizes a `logo.png` local file to 100x100 pixels.

```json title="sst.config.ts"
{
  nodejs: { install: ["sharp"] }
}
```

We don't need a layer to deploy this because `sharp` comes with a pre-built binary for Lambda.
This is handled by [`nodejs.install`](/docs/component/aws/function#nodejs-install).

:::tip
You don't need to use a Lambda layer to use Sharp.
:::

In dev, this uses the sharp npm package locally.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "sharp": "^0.33.5"
  }
}
```

On deploy, SST will use the right binary from the sharp package for the target Lambda
architecture.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const func = new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  url: true,
  handler: "index.handler",
  nodejs: { install: ["sharp"] },
  copyFiles: [{ from: "logo.png" }],
});

return {
  url: func.url,
};
```

## AWS static site basic auth

This deploys a simple static site and adds basic auth to it.

This is useful for dev environments where you want to share a static site with your team but
ensure that it's not publicly accessible.

This works by injecting some code into a CloudFront function that checks the basic auth
header and matches it against the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` secrets.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  injection: $interpolate`
    if (
        !event.request.headers.authorization
          || event.request.headers.authorization.value !== "Basic ${basicAuth}"
       ) {
      return {
        statusCode: 401,
        headers: {
          "www-authenticate": { value: "Basic" }
        }
      };
    }`,
}
```

To deploy this, you need to first set the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` secrets.

```bash
sst secret set USERNAME my-username
sst secret set PASSWORD my-password
```

If you are deploying this to preview environments, you might want to set the secrets using
the [`--fallback`](/docs/reference/cli#secret) flag.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const username = new sst.Secret("USERNAME");
const password = new sst.Secret("PASSWORD");
const basicAuth = $resolve([username.value, password.value]).apply(
  ([username, password]) =>
    Buffer.from(`${username}:${password}`).toString("base64")
);

new sst.aws.StaticSite("MySite", {
  path: "site",
  // Don't password protect prod
  edge: $app.stage !== "production"
    ? {
      viewerRequest: {
        injection: $interpolate`
          if (
              !event.request.headers.authorization
                || event.request.headers.authorization.value !== "Basic ${basicAuth}"
             ) {
            return {
              statusCode: 401,
              headers: {
                "www-authenticate": { value: "Basic" }
              }
            };
          }`,
      },
    }
    : undefined,
});
```

## AWS static site

Deploy a simple HTML file as a static site with S3 and CloudFront. The website is stored in
the `site/` directory.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
new sst.aws.StaticSite("MySite", {
  path: "site",
});
```

---
## Swift in Lambda

Deploys a simple Swift application to Lambda using the `al2023` runtime.

:::note
Building this function requires Docker.
:::

Check out the README in the repo for more details.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const swift = new sst.aws.Function("Swift", {
  runtime: "provided.al2023",
  architecture: process.arch === "arm64" ? "arm64" : "x86_64",
  bundle: build("app"),
  handler: "bootstrap",
  url: true,
});
const router = new sst.aws.Router("SwiftRouter", {
  routes: {
    "/*": swift.url,
  },
  domain: "swift.dev.sst.dev",
});
return {
  url: router.url,
};
```

## T3 Stack in AWS

Deploy [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg) with Drizzle and Postgres to AWS. To use this
example run:

```bash
npm install
npm run db:push
npx sst dev
```

And deploy it to production with.

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```

This example was created using `create-t3-app` and the following options: tRPC, Drizzle,
no auth, Tailwind, Postgres, and the App Router

Instead of a local database, we'll be using an RDS Postgres database and connect to it
with the RDS Data API.

```ts title="src/server/db/index.ts"
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/aws-data-api/pg";
import { RDSDataClient } from "@aws-sdk/client-rds-data";

import * as schema from "./schema";

const client = new RDSDataClient({});

export const db = drizzle(client, {
  schema,
  database: Resource.MyPostgres.database,
  secretArn: Resource.MyPostgres.secretArn,
  resourceArn: Resource.MyPostgres.clusterArn,
});
```

In our Next.js app we can access our Postgres database because we [link them](/docs/linking/)
both. We don't need to use our `.env` files.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {4}
 const rds = new sst.aws.Postgres("MyPostgres", { vpc });

 new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", {
   link: [rds]
 });
```

For Drizzle Kit, we use the `aws-data-api` driver.

```ts title="drizzle.config.ts" {5}
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { type Config } from "drizzle-kit";

export default {
  driver: "aws-data-api",
  schema: "./src/server/db/schema.ts",
  dialect: "postgresql",
  dbCredentials: {
    database: Resource.MyPostgres.database,
    secretArn: Resource.MyPostgres.secretArn,
    resourceArn: Resource.MyPostgres.clusterArn,
  },
  tablesFilter: ["aws-t3_*"],
} satisfies Config;
```

And to make sure our credentials are available, we update our `package.json`
with the [`sst shell`](/docs/reference/cli) CLI.

```json title="package.json"
"db:generate": "sst shell drizzle-kit generate",
"db:migrate": "sst shell drizzle-kit migrate",
"db:push": "sst shell drizzle-kit push",
"db:studio": "sst shell drizzle-kit studio",
```

So running `npm run db:push` will run Drizzle Kit with the right credentials.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc");
const rds = new sst.aws.Postgres("MyPostgres", { vpc });

new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", {
  link: [rds]
});
```

## Subscribe to topics

Create an SNS topic, publish to it from a function, and subscribe to it with a function and a queue.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const queue = new sst.aws.Queue("MyQueue");
queue.subscribe("subscriber.handler");

const topic = new sst.aws.SnsTopic("MyTopic");
topic.subscribe("subscriber.handler", {});
topic.subscribeQueue(queue.arn);

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "publisher.handler",
  link: [topic],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
  topic: topic.name,
};
```

---
## Vector search

Store and search for vector data using the Vector component. Includes a seeder API that
uses an LLM to generate embeddings for some movies and optionally their posters.

Once seeded, you can call the search API to query the vector database.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const OpenAiApiKey = new sst.Secret("OpenAiApiKey");
const vector = new sst.aws.Vector("MyVectorDB", {
  dimension: 1536,
});

const seeder = new sst.aws.Function("Seeder", {
  handler: "index.seeder",
  link: [OpenAiApiKey, vector],
  copyFiles: [
    { from: "iron-man.jpg", to: "iron-man.jpg" },
    {
      from: "black-widow.jpg",
      to: "black-widow.jpg",
    },
    {
      from: "spider-man.jpg",
      to: "spider-man.jpg",
    },
    { from: "thor.jpg", to: "thor.jpg" },
    {
      from: "captain-america.jpg",
      to: "captain-america.jpg",
    },
  ],
  url: true,
});

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "index.app",
  link: [OpenAiApiKey, vector],
  url: true,
});

return { seeder: seeder.url, app: app.url };
```

## React SPA with Vite

Deploy a React single-page app (SPA) with Vite to S3 and CloudFront.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
new sst.aws.StaticSite("Web", {
  build: {
    command: "pnpm run build",
    output: "dist",
  },
});
```

## Cloudflare KV

This example creates a Cloudflare KV namespace and links it to a worker. Now you can use the
SDK to interact with the KV namespace in your worker.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const storage = new sst.cloudflare.Kv("MyStorage");
const worker = new sst.cloudflare.Worker("Worker", {
  url: true,
  link: [storage],
  handler: "index.ts",
});

return {
  url: worker.url,
};
```

---
## Link multiple secrets

You might have multiple secrets that need to be used across your app. It can be tedious to
create a new secret and link it to each function or resource.

A common pattern to addresses this is to create an object with all your secrets and then
link them all at once. Now when you have a new secret, you can add it to the object and
it will be automatically available to all your resources.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
// Manage all secrets together
const secrets = {
  secret1: new sst.Secret("Secret1", "some-secret-value-1"),
  secret2: new sst.Secret("Secret2", "some-secret-value-2"),
};
const allSecrets = Object.values(secrets);

const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");

const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyApi", {
  link: [bucket, ...allSecrets],
  handler: "index.handler",
  url: true,
});

return {
  url: api.url,
};
```

---
## Default function props

Set default props for all the functions in your app using the global [`$transform`](/docs/reference/global/#transform).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
$transform(sst.aws.Function, (args) => {
  args.runtime = "nodejs14.x";
  args.environment = {
    FOO: "BAR",
  };
});
new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  handler: "index.ts",
});
```

---
## Vercel domains

Creates a router that uses domains purchased through and hosted in your Vercel account.
Ensure the `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_TEAM_ID` environment variables are set.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
  domain: {
    name: "ion.sst.moe",
    dns: sst.vercel.dns({ domain: "sst.moe" }),
  },
  routes: {
    "/*": "https://sst.dev",
  },
});
return {
  router: router.url,
};
```
