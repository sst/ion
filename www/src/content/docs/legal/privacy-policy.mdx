5. **Do you automatically collect technical data, and why?**

   Like many websites, we automatically collect technical data when you visit and use our Platform.

   **IP Addresses**: We may collect your IP address when you visit our Platform to help us diagnose problems with our main computers, to administer the Platform and system, to report aggregated information to our partners, and to audit the use of our Platform. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. In limited circumstances, we may use IP addresses to help us identify you when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Software as a Service Agreement or to protect our Services, the Platform, users or others.

   **Cookies and similar technologies**: We use “cookies”, scripts, pixel tags, etags, web beacons and other similar technologies on certain pages of our Platform. These automatically collect data from a visitor to our Platform and transfer this information to the visitor’s hard drive. Cookies help us recognize repeat visitors, personalize the Platform and communications and tailor content to match particular interests. We also use these technologies to track Platform usage trends and patterns.

   - **Opt out of cookies.** You are always free to set your browser to decline cookies and you can delete them from your computer. If you decline “cookies” or delete them from your computer, you will still be able to access our Platform, but you may find that some areas do not work as smoothly as when cookies are enabled on your system.

6. **Do you share personal information?**

   We may share personal information with third party service providers who assist us in providing and administering the Platform and our Services. Third parties may assist us with services such as data hosting and marketing. These third parties that process personal information on our behalf are contractually obligated to safeguard information and only use the information provided to them for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

   We may share information with our business and promotional partners to send you information, by email, telephone or other means, about products and services you may like. Users may opt-out of receiving communications at any time. See Section 11 on how to opt-out of receiving promotional emails.

   AI may provide certain demographic information to third parties in connection with providing the Services to you.

7. **Do you aggregate personal information?**

   We may aggregate (i.e. assemble on a basis that does not enable one to personally identify you) the information we collect from you, including any technical data we automatically collect. Aggregated or “de-identified data” means that information that does not identify an individual and no longer considered “personal information”. Aggregated data may be used by us to improve our Services and for marketing or resale purposes, and may be shared with and used by advertisers and other third parties. We may also use aggregate data to determine what types of products and services are best suited for our customers and are requested by our customers. If we share aggregated data to third parties, personal information will not be individually identifiable in the aggregated data.

8. **Other websites and your information**

   Our Platform may be linked from another website, or have links to other websites such as social media platforms. This Privacy Policy only relates to our collection and use of your information on the Platform and we are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other third party websites, including from any provided links. If you would like information on any other party’s privacy policy, you should contact that party directly, and we encourage you to do so.
