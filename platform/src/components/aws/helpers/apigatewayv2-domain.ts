   *
   * :::tip
   * You need to pass in a `cert` for domains that are not hosted on supported `dns` providers.
   * :::
   *
   * To manually set up a domain on an unsupported provider, you'll need to:
   *
   * 1. [Validate that you own the domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/domain-ownership-validation.html) by creating an ACM certificate. You can either validate it by setting a DNS record or by verifying an email sent to the domain owner.
   * 2. Once validated, set the certificate ARN as the `cert` and set `dns` to `false`.
   * 3. Add the DNS records in your provider to point to the API Gateway URL.
   *
   * @example
   * ```js
   * {
   *   domain: {
   *     name: "example.com",
   *     dns: false,
   *     cert: "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:112233445566:certificate/3a958790-8878-4cdc-a396-06d95064cf63"
   *   }
   * }

   *
   * Supports Route 53, Cloudflare, and Vercel adapters. For other providers, you'll need
   * to set `dns` to `false` and pass in a certificate validating ownership via `cert`.
   *
   * @default `sst.aws.dns`
   *
   * @example
   *
   * Specify the hosted zone ID for the Route 53 domain.
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   domain: {
   *     name: "example.com",
   *     dns: sst.aws.dns({

   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Use a domain hosted on Cloudflare, needs the Cloudflare provider.
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   domain: {
   *     name: "example.com",
   *     dns: sst.cloudflare.dns()
   *   }
   * }
