Ion is a new engine for deploying SST apps. It uses Pulumi and Terraform, as opposed to CDK and CloudFormation. [Read the full announcement here](https://sst.dev/blog/moving-away-from-cdk.html).

- **10x faster** deploys
- Native **multi-region** support
- No more cyclical dependencies
- No stacks or stack resource limits
- No CDK or npm package conflicts
- Native support for **non-AWS** providers

_Note: Ion is generally available and recommended for new SST users. We are working on a migration path for SST v2 users._
